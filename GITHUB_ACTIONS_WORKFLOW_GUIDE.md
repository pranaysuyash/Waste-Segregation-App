## Overview

This document outlines the complete GitHub Actions workflow and development process for the Waste Segregation App, including exact commands, branch protection rules, CI/CD pipeline, and the systematic approach we follow for all feature implementations.

---

## üîÑ Standard Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Feature Branch Creation

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch with descriptive name
git checkout -b feature/[descriptive-name]
# Examples:
# git checkout -b feature/implement-single-points-manager
# git checkout -b feature/fix-premium-features-route
# git checkout -b feature/fix-instant-analysis-duplicate-detection
```

### Phase 2: Development and Testing

```bash
# 3. Make your changes and test locally
flutter test                                    # Run unit tests
flutter analyze                                # Static analysis
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env      # Test app functionality

# 4. Commit changes with descriptive messages
git add .
git commit -m "feat: [descriptive commit message]

- Bullet point of key changes
- Another important change
- Reference to issue/battle plan item if applicable"
```

### Phase 3: Push and Create PR

```bash
# 5. Push feature branch to remote
git push origin feature/[branch-name]

# 6. Create Pull Request using GitHub CLI
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: [Descriptive Title (Battle Plan Item #X)]" \
  --body "## Summary

Brief description of what this PR accomplishes.

## Changes Made

- Key change 1
- Key change 2
- Key change 3

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Flutter analyze clean
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] No breaking changes

## Battle Plan Progress

- ‚úÖ Item #X: [Description] - **COMPLETED**

## Related Issues

Fixes #[issue-number] (if applicable)" \
  --assignee @me \
  --label enhancement
```

### Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline and Merge

```bash
# 7. Monitor CI checks (automatic)
gh pr checks [PR-NUMBER]

# 8. Merge PR (with admin privileges if needed for critical fixes)
gh pr merge [PR-NUMBER] --squash --delete-branch --admin

# 9. Switch back to main and pull latest
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection Rules

### Current Protection Settings

The `main` branch is protected with the following rules:

1. **Required Status Checks**:
   - `golden-test` - Visual regression testing
   - `Storybook visual-diff` - UI component testing
   - `build_and_test` - Core build and unit tests
   - `comprehensive_testing` - Extended test suite

2. **Branch Protection Features**:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Dismiss stale PR reviews when new commits are pushed
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Include administrators in restrictions

3. **Admin Override**:
   - Use `--admin` flag for critical fixes that need immediate deployment
   - Only use for urgent production issues or battle plan items

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Details

### Automatic Checks on PR Creation

1. **Build Validation**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter analyze
   flutter test
   ```

2. **Visual Regression Testing**
   ```bash
   flutter test --update-goldens  # Generate golden files
   flutter test integration_test/  # Run visual tests
   ```

3. **Security Scanning**
   ```bash
   # Dependency vulnerability scanning
   # Code security analysis
   # License compliance checks
   ```

4. **Performance Testing**
   ```bash
   # Memory usage analysis
   # Build time optimization
   # App startup performance
   ```

### Manual Override Commands

```bash
# For critical fixes that need immediate deployment
gh pr merge [PR-NUMBER] --squash --delete-branch --admin

# Check CI status
gh pr checks [PR-NUMBER]

# View detailed CI logs
gh run view [RUN-ID]

# Re-run failed checks
gh run rerun [RUN-ID]
```

---

## üìä Monitoring and Validation

### Post-Merge Validation

```bash
# After successful merge, validate main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Run full test suite
flutter test
flutter analyze

# Verify app functionality
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env

# Check for any regressions
flutter test integration_test/
```

### Documentation Updates

```bash
# Always update documentation after major changes
git add [documentation-files]
git commit -m "docs: Update [specific documentation] - [change description]"
git push origin main
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### CI Check Failures

1. **Golden Test Failures**
   ```bash
   # Update golden files locally
   flutter test --update-goldens
   git add test/
   git commit -m "test: Update golden files for UI changes"
   git push origin [branch-name]
   ```

2. **Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Clean and rebuild
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter analyze
   flutter test
   ```

3. **Branch Protection Bypass**
   ```bash
   # Only for critical production fixes
   gh pr merge [PR-NUMBER] --squash --delete-branch --admin
   ```

### Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Resolve conflicts with main
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main
# Resolve conflicts manually
git add .
git commit -m "resolve: Merge conflicts with main"
git push origin [branch-name]
```
