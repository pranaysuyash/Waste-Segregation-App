## [0.1.6+103] - 2025-06-06

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Cloud Sync**: Fixed failure when uploading more than 500 classifications by
  splitting write batches and committing pending operations reliably. Sync count
  now reflects user data uploads even if admin logging fails.

## [0.1.6+102] - 2025-01-04

### üìö Documentation
- **Environment Setup Guide**: Added critical documentation for development environment setup (`docs/technical/development/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`). Emphasizes the requirement to use `.env` file with `--dart-define-from-file=.env` for proper API key configuration during development.

### üõ†Ô∏è Performance Optimizations  
- **Service Instantiation Optimization**: Completed optimization of both `CloudStorageService` and `AiService` to use singleton pattern for `GamificationService` and `EnhancedImageService` respectively. Eliminates repeated service instantiation overhead and adds proper error handling.

## [0.1.6+101] - 2025-01-04

### üõ†Ô∏è Performance Optimizations
- **Service Instantiation Optimization**: Optimized `CloudStorageService` to use singleton pattern for `GamificationService` instances instead of creating new instances repeatedly
  - Added `_gamificationService` as a class field using `late final` initialization
  - Replaced repeated `GamificationService(_localStorageService, this)` instantiations with reusable field
  - Added error handling for gamification processing to prevent failures from affecting classification saves
  - Improves performance by eliminating redundant service instantiation overhead
  - Follows dependency injection best practices for better resource management

## [0.1.6+100] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed
- **Gamification Points Reset**: Resolved an issue where users' gamification points and profile would reset upon logging in with Google Sign-In. The sign-in process now correctly fetches the existing `UserProfile` (including `GamificationProfile`) from Firestore before creating or updating the local profile. This ensures that the authoritative cloud data is prioritized, preventing data loss.
  - Modified `GoogleDriveService.signIn()` to fetch from Firestore using the Google account ID.
  - If a profile exists in Firestore, it's updated and used locally.
  - If no profile exists in Firestore (new user), a new local profile is created (and `GamificationService` initializes its gamification aspects).

## [0.1.6+99] - 2025-01-04

### üö® CRITICAL COMPILATION FIXES
- **FIXED**: Major gamification model compatibility issues preventing app compilation
- **FIXED**: GamificationProfile streak property migration from single `streak` to `streaks` map

- **FIXED**: GamificationService completely rewritten to support new StreakDetails model
- **FIXED**: Missing required parameters in GamificationProfile constructors

### üîß Model Structure Updates
- **MIGRATED**: `GamificationProfile.streak: Streak` ‚Üí `GamificationProfile.streaks: Map<String, StreakDetails>`
- **ADDED**: Support for multiple streak types (dailyClassification, dailyLearning, etc.)
- **ADDED**: Required fields: `discoveredItemIds`, `unlockedHiddenContentIds`
- **ENHANCED**: StreakDetails with maintenance tracking and milestone awards

### üéØ Service Layer Fixes
- **REWRITTEN**: `GamificationService.updateStreak()` method for new model structure
- **MAINTAINED**: Backward compatibility through legacy Streak return types
- **FIXED**: All constructor calls to use new required parameters
- **ENHANCED**: Helper methods for accessing streak data across UI components

### üß™ Test Infrastructure Impact
- **IDENTIFIED**: Test failures were revealing real compilation issues, not test problems
- **RESOLVED**: Core application now compiles successfully
- **REMAINING**: Test files need updates to match new model structure
- **APPROACH**: Fixed underlying issues first, test updates to follow

### üìä Quality Metrics
