## [0.1.6+100] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed
- **Gamification Points Reset**: Resolved an issue where users' gamification points and profile would reset upon logging in with Google Sign-In. The sign-in process now correctly fetches the existing `UserProfile` (including `GamificationProfile`) from Firestore before creating or updating the local profile. This ensures that the authoritative cloud data is prioritized, preventing data loss.
  - Modified `GoogleDriveService.signIn()` to fetch from Firestore using the Google account ID.
  - If a profile exists in Firestore, it's updated and used locally.
  - If no profile exists in Firestore (new user), a new local profile is created (and `GamificationService` initializes its gamification aspects).

- **Recovery Metadata**: Tracks backup status for each user without exposing personal info

### üèóÔ∏è FIRESTORE COLLECTIONS STRUCTURE

## [1.8.1] - 2024-07-26

### Fixed
- **ResultScreen Compilation Errors**: Resolved multiple compilation errors in `lib/screens/result_screen.dart` caused by incorrect widget nesting, duplicate method declarations, and calls to undefined methods. The screen is now compilable and functional.
- **Modern UI Integration**: Refactored the `ResultScreen` to correctly use available "Modern UI" components like `GlassmorphismCard` and `ActionButtons`, replacing custom boilerplate and ensuring a consistent look and feel.
- **Gamification Display**: Fixed an issue where the `Challenge` model was accessed with a `.name` property instead of `.title`, causing errors in displaying completed challenge information.
- **Tag Display**: Corrected the implementation of interactive tags on the `ResultScreen` to use the existing `ClassificationCard`'s tag display mechanism, removing faulty implementations that used non-existent widgets.

### Changed
- **UI Component Usage**: Replaced direct implementation of buttons and cards on the `ResultScreen` with standardized widgets from `lib/widgets/modern_ui/` and `lib/widgets/result_screen/`.
- **Code Structure**: Restructured the `build` method in `ResultScreen` to be more readable and maintainable by removing nested conditional logic and using a cleaner widget hierarchy.
