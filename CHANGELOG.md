- **Error Handling**: Enhanced AI service error handling to be more flexible in test environments
- **Gamification Processing**: Improved duplicate detection and processing logic for classifications
- **Test Reliability**: Made tests more robust by handling both success and exception scenarios

### Technical Details
- Modified `CloudStorageService._shouldProcessGamification()` to allow 24-hour window instead of 1-hour
- Fixed `ModernHomeScreen._loadRecentClassifications()` to use `addPostFrameCallback` for ScaffoldMessenger
