##### 3.3.4. Alternative Approaches / Options Considered

*   **Real-time vs. Batched Updates:**
    *   **Real-time (Current for All-Time):** Updates user's leaderboard entry immediately when points change. Good for immediate feedback.
    *   **Batched Updates:** For period-based leaderboards or very high-traffic systems, points might be aggregated and ranks updated periodically (e.g., every few minutes or hourly) by a scheduled function to reduce write operations.
*   **Calculating Ranks:**
    *   **On-the-fly (partially done by ordering):** Firestore can order by points. Determining exact numerical rank for *every* user outside the fetched limit requires more complex queries or post-processing.
    *   **Storing Rank in Document:** Update a `rank` field in each `LeaderboardEntry` document. This requires more complex update logic (e.g., a Cloud Function to recalculate ranks when scores change significantly), but makes fetching a user's specific rank very fast. (The `rank` field in `LeaderboardEntry` model is nullable, anticipating this.)

##### 3.3.5. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **Scalable Rank Calculation:** Efficiently calculating and updating ranks for many users, especially for multiple leaderboard types. Cloud Functions might be necessary for periodic rank calculations or for updating ranks when scores change.
*   **Data Denormalization & Consistency:** Managing denormalized data (displayName, photoUrl) across leaderboard entries and ensuring it's updated when user profiles change.
*   **Firestore Query Limitations:** Designing schemas and queries that work efficiently for various leaderboard views (e.g., top N, user's rank, friends' ranks). Composite indexes will be crucial.
*   **Scheduled Resets for Periodic Leaderboards:** Implementing reliable scheduled functions (e.g., Cloud Functions with Cloud Scheduler) to reset weekly/monthly leaderboards, archive past results, and potentially award prizes.
*   **Data Archiving:** Storing historical leaderboard data efficiently.
*   **UI Complexity:** Managing the UI for switching between and displaying multiple leaderboard types.
*   **Increased Firestore Costs:** More collections/documents and more frequent reads/writes for diverse leaderboards.

### 3.7. Authentication System

-   **Cross-reference UX/UI Analysis:** While not a dedicated screen in the UX analysis, authentication underpins User Profile (4.6) and the overall personalized app experience.

##### 3.7.1. Current Functionality

*   **User Sign-up & Sign-in:** Allows users to create accounts and sign in to the application. This is likely handled by Firebase Authentication.
*   **Authentication Providers (Assumed):**
    *   Email/Password authentication.
    *   Social sign-in providers (e.g., Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In) are common and good for UX.
*   **Session Management:** Firebase Auth handles user sessions, persisting login state across app launches.
*   **User Identification:** Provides a unique `userId` for each authenticated user, which is crucial for linking all user-specific data (profile, history, gamification, etc.).
*   **Logout:** Functionality to sign out the current user, clearing their session.
*   **Password Reset (for Email/Password):** Firebase Auth typically provides mechanisms for users to reset forgotten passwords.

##### 3.7.2. Data Sources & Dependencies

*   **Primary Data Source:** Firebase Authentication backend (manages user credentials, tokens, etc.).
*   **Primary Firestore Collection(s):**
    *   `users/{userId}`: While Auth handles credentials, the app creates a user document in Firestore (e.g., `UserProfile`) upon successful sign-up/first sign-in, keyed by the Firebase `userId`.
*   **Other Data Models Involved:**
    *   `UserProfile` (created/linked upon authentication).
*   **Service(s) Utilized:**
    *   `AuthService` (or similar wrapper around Firebase Auth SDK) to provide methods for sign-up, sign-in, logout, get current user, password reset, etc.
    *   `CloudStorageService` (or `UserAccountService`) to create the `UserProfile` document in Firestore after successful authentication.
*   **External Dependencies (APIs, Libraries):**
    *   Firebase Authentication SDK (e.g., `firebase_auth` Flutter plugin).
    *   Social sign-in SDKs (e.g., `google_sign_in`, `sign_in_with_apple` Flutter plugins).

##### 3.7.3. Potential Additional Functionality / Enhancements

*   **Anonymous Authentication:** Allow users to use core app features (like classification) without creating a full account initially. Their data can be tied to an anonymous `userId`. Provide an option to later link their anonymous account to a permanent account (email/social).
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** For enhanced security, offer MFA options (e.g., SMS, authenticator app), though this is an advanced feature for most consumer apps.
*   **Account Linking:** Allow users to link multiple authentication providers (e.g., sign up with email, later link Google account) to the same app account.
*   **Magic Link Authentication:** Passwordless sign-in where users receive a unique link via email to log in.
*   **Customizable Auth UI:** More branded and user-friendly sign-in/sign-up screens than default Firebase UI (if it was ever used).
*   **Account Recovery Options:** Beyond password reset, offer other account recovery mechanisms if applicable.
*   **Terms of Service & Privacy Policy Acceptance:** Ensure users accept ToS and Privacy Policy during sign-up, and record this acceptance.
*   **Email Verification:** Enforce email verification after sign-up with email/password to ensure valid email addresses.

##### 3.7.4. Alternative Approaches / Options Considered

*   **Custom Backend Authentication:** Building a proprietary authentication system. Significantly more complex and less secure than using established providers like Firebase Auth. Generally not recommended unless very specific needs exist.
*   **Other Third-Party Auth Providers:** Services like Auth0, AWS Cognito. Firebase Auth is well-integrated with the Flutter/Firebase ecosystem.

##### 3.7.5. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **User Profile & Settings Management:** Authentication is the foundation. The `userId` links to the `UserProfile`.
*   **All Personalized Features:** Any feature that stores or displays user-specific data (Classification History, Gamification, Leaderboards, personalized Educational Content) relies on the `userId` from the authenticated session.
*   **Firestore Security Rules:** Security rules heavily depend on `request.auth.uid` to control access to user-specific data.
*   **Cloud Functions:** Authenticated user context (`context.auth`) is often used in Cloud Functions for permission checks and user-specific operations.

##### 3.7.6. User Benefits of Enhancements

*   **Improved Accessibility & Lower Barrier to Entry:** Anonymous authentication allows users to try the app before committing to an account.
*   **Enhanced Security:** MFA (if implemented).
*   **Greater Convenience:** Social sign-in, magic links simplify login.
*   **Account Management Flexibility:** Account linking.

##### 3.7.7. Technical Considerations & Challenges for Enhancements

*   **Anonymous-to-Permanent Account Linking:** Requires careful handling of data migration and merging if an anonymous user later creates a full account.
*   **MFA Implementation:** Integrating MFA providers and managing the user flows.
*   **Magic Link Implementation:** Requires backend logic to generate and validate unique tokens.
*   **UI/UX for Auth Flows:** Designing clear and secure UI for sign-up, sign-in, password reset, account linking, and error handling is critical.
*   **Security Best Practices:** Adhering to all security best practices for handling credentials, sessions, and sensitive user data (Firebase Auth handles much of this, but app-level logic must also be secure).
*   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handling various authentication errors (wrong password, account exists, network issues, provider errors).
*   **Terms of Service/Privacy Policy Flow:** Integrating this into the sign-up flow and versioning/re-acceptance if policies change.
*   **Email Verification Flow:** Managing user states (verified/unverified) and potentially restricting access to certain features until email is verified.

    *   Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) SDK (e.g., `firebase_messaging` Flutter plugin).
    *   Flutter Local Notifications plugin (e.g., `flutter_local_notifications`) for displaying foreground notifications or creating custom notification appearances.
    *   Firestore (for preferences and triggering events).
    *   Firebase Functions (for backend notification logic).

##### 3.8.3. Potential Additional Functionality / Enhancements

*   **Granular Notification Controls:** Allow users to toggle specific notification categories (e.g., challenges, educational content, social, leaderboard changes) rather than an all-or-nothing approach.
*   **In-App Notifications/Messages:** Display less urgent updates or information as in-app messages or banners instead of system push notifications.
*   **Personalized Notification Content:** Tailor notification messages based on user activity or preferences (e.g., "You're close to unlocking the 'Plastic Recycler' badge!").
*   **Scheduled/Reminder Notifications:** Allow users to set reminders for specific tasks (e.g., "Remind me to check new educational content on Friday").
*   **Quiet Hours/Do Not Disturb:** Respect user-defined quiet hours for sending notifications.
*   **Notification History/Center:** An in-app section where users can view a history of recent notifications they've received from the app.
*   **Rich Push Notifications:** Use images or interactive elements within push notifications (platform-dependent capabilities).
*   **Opt-in for Specific Topics:** Allow users to subscribe to notifications for specific educational categories or challenge types.
*   **Frequency Capping:** Limit the number of notifications a user receives within a certain timeframe to avoid annoyance.

##### 3.8.4. Alternative Approaches / Options Considered

*   **Third-Party Notification Services:** Services like OneSignal offer advanced features for segmentation, A/B testing, and analytics for notifications. However, FCM is deeply integrated with Firebase.
*   **Polling (Not for real-time):** For less critical updates, the app could periodically poll for new information, but this is inefficient compared to push notifications for real-time alerts.

##### 3.8.5. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **Gamification System:** Major source of events that can trigger notifications (badges, challenges, streaks, level-ups).

### 3.10. Offline Support & Data Synchronization

-   **Cross-reference UX/UI Analysis:** Implicitly desired for a good user experience, especially for core features like classification and accessing previously viewed content/history when connectivity is poor or unavailable. Mentions in History (4.3), Educational Content (4.4), and potentially Core Classification (offline mode for common items).

##### 3.10.1. Current Functionality (Assumed/Planned)

*   **Limited or No Offline Support (Likely):** Most features likely require an active internet connection to interact with Firebase services (Firestore, Auth, AI backend).
*   **Firebase SDK Caching (Basic):** Firebase SDKs (especially Firestore) have some level of built-in disk caching for recently accessed data. This might provide a basic offline experience for recently viewed data, but it's not a full offline solution.
*   **No Explicit Sync Logic:** Unlikely to have sophisticated custom synchronization logic beyond what Firebase provides by default.

##### 3.10.2. Data Sources & Dependencies

*   **Local Data Storage (Client-Side):**
    *   SQLite database (e.g., using `sqflite` or `drift` plugins in Flutter).
    *   Hive (NoSQL key-value store, good for Dart objects).
    *   Shared Preferences (for simple key-value data, not suitable for complex offline data).
*   **Data Models to be Cached/Synced:**
    *   `UserProfile`, `GamificationProfile`.
    *   `WasteClassification` (user's history).
    *   `EducationalContent` (articles/guides marked for offline access).
    *   `LeaderboardEntry` (cached views of leaderboards).
    *   Queue of pending actions (e.g., classifications made offline).
*   **Service(s) Utilized:**
    *   A dedicated `OfflineSyncService` or similar to manage:
        *   Storing data locally.
        *   Retrieving data from local cache when offline.
        *   Queuing user actions made offline.
        *   Syncing local changes with Firestore when connectivity returns.
        *   Handling data conflicts during synchronization.
    *   Existing services (`CloudStorageService`, `GamificationService`, `HistoryService`, `EducationalContentService`) would need to be modified to interact with this offline service (e.g., try local cache first, then network; write to local cache then queue for sync).
*   **External Dependencies (APIs, Libraries):**
    *   Local database plugins (e.g., `sqflite`, `drift`, `hive`).
    *   Connectivity checking plugin (e.g., `connectivity_plus`).
    *   Firestore, Firebase Auth (as the backend to sync with).

### 3.13. Error Reporting & Monitoring System

-   **Cross-reference UX/UI Analysis:** Not a direct user-facing feature, but crucial for overall app stability and a positive user experience by enabling developers to quickly identify and fix issues.

##### 3.13.1. Current Functionality (Assumed/Partially Implemented)

*   **Firebase Crashlytics (Likely):** Given the use of Firebase, it's highly probable that Firebase Crashlytics is integrated (or planned) for automatic crash reporting for native crashes and unhandled Dart exceptions.
*   **Basic Logging (Potentially):** Developers might be using `print()` statements or a simple logging utility during development, but this isn't a systematic error monitoring solution for production.
*   **Flutter Error Handling:** Flutter's built-in error handling mechanisms (e.g., `ErrorWidget.builder` for build errors, `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` for unhandled async errors) might be in place to catch some errors.

##### 3.13.2. Data Sources & Dependencies

*   **Primary Data Source:** Error and crash data collected by services like Firebase Crashlytics, Firebase Performance Monitoring.
*   **Service(s) Utilized (by the app to report errors):**
    *   Firebase Crashlytics SDK (e.g., `firebase_crashlytics` Flutter plugin).
    *   Firebase Performance Monitoring SDK (e.g., `firebase_performance` Flutter plugin).
    *   Potentially a custom logging service that can also send logs to a remote server or Crashlytics as custom logs.
*   **External Dependencies (Platforms/Services):**
    *   Firebase Crashlytics platform (for viewing crash reports, stack traces, affected user counts).
    *   Firebase Performance Monitoring platform (for viewing performance traces, network request timings, identifying slow app startup or screen transitions).
    *   Potentially other logging/monitoring services (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) if more advanced features are needed, but Firebase tools are a good starting point.

*   **Impact on App Performance:** Error reporting and performance monitoring SDKs can have a minor overhead. Ensure they are configured correctly and not overly verbose in production.
*   **Data Privacy:** Be mindful of what data is collected with error reports (e.g., avoid logging PII unless absolutely necessary and with consent). Anonymize user identifiers where possible.
*   **Noise Reduction:** Configuring alerts and filtering reports to focus on actionable issues and avoid alert fatigue.
*   **Deobfuscation/Symbolication:** Ensuring that dSYM files (iOS) and Proguard/R8 mapping files (Android) are correctly uploaded to Crashlytics to get readable stack traces from release builds.
*   **Custom Logging Strategy:** Defining what to log, when, and at what level (debug, info, error) to provide useful context without excessive data.
*   **Network Overhead for Remote Logging:** If sending extensive custom logs, be mindful of network usage, especially for users on limited data plans.
*   **Cost of Third-Party Tools:** Some advanced monitoring services have costs associated with data volume or features.
*   **Configuration Across Environments:** Potentially different logging levels or reporting settings for development, staging, and production builds.

### 3.14. Internationalization and Localization (i18n & l10n)

-   **Cross-reference UX/UI Analysis:** `docs/design/user_experience/app_ux_ui_analysis.md` (Section 4.7 App Settings Screen suggests a language selector). Localization also impacts all text-based UI elements, educational content, and potentially date/number formatting throughout the app.

##### 3.14.1. Current Functionality (Assumed)

*   **Single Language (Likely English):** The app is probably developed with a single language (e.g., English) hardcoded in UI elements, educational content, and other text-based resources.
*   **No Built-in Localization Framework:** Unlikely to have a formal i18n/l10n framework in place yet.

##### 3.14.2. Data Sources & Dependencies

*   **Translation Files/Resources:**
    *   For Flutter, this typically involves using `.arb` (Application Resource Bundle) files for each supported locale (e.g., `app_en.arb`, `app_es.arb`).
    *   These files contain key-value pairs, where keys are identifiers for text strings and values are the translations.
*   **Data Models Involved (Potentially):**
    *   Educational content in Firestore might need a structure to support multiple languages (e.g., a `translations` map field with language codes as keys: `title: {en: "Hello", es: "Hola"}`).
    *   User profile might store a preferred language setting.
*   **Service(s) Utilized:**
    *   Flutter's built-in localization delegate (`GlobalMaterialLocalizations`, `GlobalWidgetsLocalizations`, `GlobalCupertinoLocalizations`).
    *   A custom localization delegate for app-specific strings, generated from `.arb` files (e.g., using `flutter_localizations` package and `intl` tools).
    *   Potentially a `LanguageService` or similar to manage locale changes and persist user preferences.
*   **External Dependencies (APIs, Libraries):**
    *   `flutter_localizations` (Flutter SDK package).
    *   `intl` package (for message formatting, date/time formatting, plurals, gender).
    *   Potentially translation management platforms/services (e.g., Lokalise, Phrase, Crowdin) if using professional translators or a collaborative translation workflow.

##### 3.14.7. Technical Considerations & Challenges for Enhancements

*   **Translation Management Workflow:** Establishing an efficient process for translating content, reviewing translations, and integrating them into the app. This can be a significant logistical effort, especially for many languages or frequent updates.
*   **Cost of Translation:** Professional translation services can be expensive.
*   **Layout Adjustments (LTR/RTL & Text Length):** UI layouts may need to be flexible to accommodate varying text lengths in different languages and support RTL layouts.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly testing the app in all supported languages and locales, including UI layout, text rendering, and formatting.
*   **Dynamic Content Localization Strategy:** How to efficiently store and retrieve localized versions of dynamic content from Firestore or other backends.
*   **Pluralization and Gender:** Handling grammatical rules for plurals and gender correctly in different languages requires careful use of ICU message format or similar within `.arb` files.
*   **Font Support:** Ensuring that chosen fonts support all characters for the target languages.
*   **Maintaining Translations:** Keeping translations up-to-date as the app evolves and new text strings are added or existing ones change.
*   **Context for Translators:** Providing sufficient context to translators to ensure accurate and appropriate translations.
*   **Code Internationalization:** Refactoring existing code to use localization keys instead of hardcoded strings.

-   **Cross-reference UX/UI Analysis:** `docs/design/user_experience/app_ux_ui_analysis.md` (Mentions in Home Screen for new users (4.1), and as a general global UX theme for proactive guidance. Section 5, Undocumented User Flow Opportunities, also lists "Onboarding Tour for New Features").

##### 3.15.1. Current Functionality (Assumed)

*   **Minimal Onboarding (Likely):** New users might be dropped directly into the main app (e.g., Home Screen) after the initial authentication (sign-up/sign-in) flow.
*   **Implicit Onboarding:** Users discover features by exploring the app themselves.
*   **No Formal Guided Tour or Tutorial:** Unlikely to have a structured, step-by-step introduction to core app features for first-time users.

##### 3.15.2. Data Sources & Dependencies

*   **User Profile/Settings:**
    *   A flag in `UserProfile` or local user preferences (e.g., `hasCompletedOnboarding: true`) to track whether a user has gone through the initial onboarding.
    *   Potentially, progress through specific onboarding steps if it's a multi-stage process.
*   **Service(s) Utilized:**
    *   `UserAccountService` or `SettingsService` to manage the onboarding completion status.
    *   UI services/widgets for displaying onboarding elements (e.g., tutorial overlays, carousels, tooltips).
*   **External Dependencies (APIs, Libraries):**
    *   Potentially UI libraries for creating interactive tours or showcases (e.g., `showcaseview` for Flutter, or custom-built UI elements).

##### 3.15.3. Potential Additional Functionality / Enhancements

*   **Welcome/Introductory Screens:**
    *   A brief carousel or series of screens highlighting the app's main value propositions (e.g., "Identify Waste Easily," "Learn Recycling Habits," "Earn Rewards & Compete").
*   **Interactive Guided Tour of Core Features:**
    *   Contextual overlays or tooltips pointing out key UI elements and actions on first launch of main screens (e.g., "Tap here to classify your first item," "Check your progress on the Leaderboard here").
    *   Guide users through their first classification.
*   **Personalization Setup (Optional):**
    *   Allow users to set initial preferences or interests (e.g., "I'm most interested in learning about composting" or "My main goal is to reduce plastic waste"). This can tailor subsequent educational content or challenges.
*   **Permissions Priming:** Explain why certain permissions (e.g., camera, notifications, location) are needed before the OS-level prompt appears.
*   **Sample Content/Empty State Guidance:** For features like History or Leaderboards, show helpful empty states for new users that guide them on how to populate these sections.
*   **Checklist for Getting Started:** A simple checklist of initial actions for users to complete (e.g., "Classify your first item," "Explore an educational guide," "View your profile").
*   **Video Tutorial (Optional):** A short, engaging video overview of the app.
*   **Skippable Onboarding:** Always provide an option for users to skip the onboarding tour if they prefer.
*   **Contextual Tips for New Users:** After initial onboarding, provide contextual hints or tips when users access features for the first or second time.
*   **Onboarding for New Features (as per UX analysis):** When significant new features are released, provide a brief in-app tour for existing users.

##### 3.15.4. Alternative Approaches / Options Considered

*   **Single Welcome Video vs. Interactive Tour:** Video is passive; interactive tours are more engaging but require more effort to build.
*   **Mandatory vs. Skippable Onboarding:** Skippable is generally preferred to avoid frustrating experienced users or those who want to explore on their own.
*   **Progressive Onboarding:** Introduce features contextually as the user encounters them, rather than a long upfront tour.
*   **Gamified Onboarding:** Award small points or a special "Welcome" badge for completing onboarding steps.

##### 3.15.5. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **Authentication:** Onboarding typically occurs immediately after a new user signs up or logs in for the first time.
*   **Core Image Classification:** A key part of onboarding could be guiding the user through their first successful classification.
*   **Educational Content:** Onboarding might introduce the Learn section or even suggest a beginner-friendly article.
*   **Gamification System:** Could explain the basics of points, badges, and challenges. Completing onboarding might be the first achievement.
*   **User Profile & Settings Management:** Onboarding status is stored per user. May guide user to complete their profile.
*   **Home Screen:** The starting point for many onboarding flows, and might look slightly different for a first-time user until certain actions are completed.

##### 3.15.6. User Benefits of Enhancements

*   **Reduced Learning Curve:** Helps new users understand how to use the app and its features more quickly.
*   **Increased Initial Engagement:** A good onboarding experience can make users feel more welcome and motivated to explore.

*   **Improved User Retention:** Users who understand and successfully use an app early on are more likely to continue using it.
*   **Clear Value Proposition:** Reinforces why the user downloaded the app and how it can benefit them.

##### 3.15.7. Technical Considerations & Challenges for Enhancements

*   **State Management for Onboarding Progress:** Reliably tracking which parts of onboarding a user has completed, especially if it's skippable or multi-stage.
*   **UI Implementation for Overlays/Tours:** Building robust and non-intrusive UI elements for guided tours (e.g., ensuring they work across different screen sizes and orientations).
*   **Triggering Onboarding Logic:** Correctly identifying first-time users or users who haven't seen onboarding for new features.
*   **Balancing Guidance with User Freedom:** Avoid making the onboarding too long, restrictive, or annoying.
*   **A/B Testing Onboarding Flows:** Experimenting with different onboarding approaches to see what works best for user activation and retention.
*   **Deep Linking and Onboarding:** If a user deep links into a specific feature, how does the onboarding flow adapt?
*   **Resetting Onboarding (for testing/support):** A developer/admin option to reset onboarding status for a user.
*   **Localization:** Onboarding content (text, images) needs to be localized if the app supports multiple languages.

### 3.16. Accessibility (A11y) Implementation

-   **Cross-reference UX/UI Analysis:** `docs/design/user_experience/app_ux_ui_analysis.md` (Section 3. Global UX/UI Themes & Opportunities - specifically Accessibility (A11y), and mentions within various screen analyses like sufficient touch targets, screen reader compatibility, font scalability, clear navigation).

##### 3.16.1. Current Functionality (Assumed)

*   **Flutter Default Accessibility:** Flutter widgets generally provide good default accessibility support (e.g., many widgets are screen reader compatible out-of-the-box).
*   **Basic Semantic Information:** Standard widgets likely have some semantic labels inferred (e.g., a `TextButton` with text "Submit" will be announced as "Submit button").
*   **No Explicit A11y-Specific Features (Likely):** The app might not yet have undergone a dedicated accessibility audit or implemented advanced A11y features beyond Flutter defaults.

##### 3.16.2. Data Sources & Dependencies

*   **No specific data sources for A11y itself.** Data is the content within the app that needs to be made accessible.
*   **Service(s) Utilized:** None specific to A11y, but all services rendering UI must be mindful of A11y principles.
*   **Flutter Framework Dependencies:**
    *   `Semantics` widget: For providing explicit accessibility information to the OS accessibility services.
    *   `ExcludeSemantics` widget: To hide decorative or redundant elements from accessibility services.
    *   `MergeSemantics` widget: To group related widgets into a single traversable unit.
    *   `MediaQuery` for detecting system settings like text scaling (`textScaleFactor`).
*   **Testing Tool Dependencies:**
    *   Flutter Inspector (Accessibility tab).
    *   Platform-specific accessibility tools (e.g., VoiceOver on iOS, TalkBack on Android, Accessibility Scanner on Android).

##### 3.16.3. Potential Additional Functionality / Enhancements

*   **Comprehensive Screen Reader Support:**
    *   Ensure all interactive elements have clear, concise, and descriptive labels (e.g., buttons with only icons must have semantic labels).
    *   Provide appropriate hints for interactive elements (e.g., "Double tap to activate").
    *   Ensure logical focus order for navigation with screen readers or keyboards.
    *   Use `Semantics` widgets to provide additional context or group related information.
    *   Announce dynamic content changes appropriately (e.g., loading states, error messages, gamification rewards).
*   **Keyboard Navigation & Focus Management:**
    *   Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard (or equivalent assistive technology like switch access).
    *   Visible focus indicators for all focusable elements.
    *   Logical navigation order when using Tab/Shift+Tab.
*   **Dynamic Font Scaling:**
    *   Ensure UI layouts adapt gracefully when users increase system font size. Avoid text truncation or overlapping elements.
    *   Test with various `textScaleFactor` values.
*   **Sufficient Color Contrast:**
    *   Verify that text and important UI elements meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) AA or AAA contrast ratios against their backgrounds.
    *   Provide alternative cues for information conveyed by color alone (e.g., icons + color for error states).
*   **Adequate Touch Target Sizes:**
    *   Ensure all interactive elements have a minimum touch target size (e.g., 44x44 dp or 48x48 dp as per platform guidelines) to be easily tappable.
*   **Reduced Motion:**
    *   Respect system settings for reduced motion. Disable or reduce non-essential animations if the user has this preference enabled (`MediaQuery.of(context).disableAnimations`).
*   **Clear and Simple Language:** Use plain language for text content where possible, especially for instructions and error messages.
*   **Accessibility for Custom Widgets/Paint:** If using custom-painted widgets, ensure they correctly implement semantics or are wrapped in appropriate `Semantics` widgets.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Use haptic feedback thoughtfully to confirm actions or provide alerts, respecting user settings.
*   **Alternative Text for Images:** Provide descriptive alt text for all informative images. Decorative images should be marked as such (e.g., via `ExcludeSemantics` or empty alt text).
*   **ARIA Attributes (for Web/Hybrid Portions):** If any part of the app uses web views, ensure proper ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are used for web content.

##### 3.16.4. Alternative Approaches / Options Considered

*   **Relying Only on Default Behaviors:** Not sufficient for a truly accessible app, as custom UIs or complex interactions often require explicit semantic information.
*   **Manual vs. Automated Testing:**
    *   **Manual Testing (Essential):** Testing with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies is crucial for understanding the actual user experience.
    *   **Automated Tools (Helpful):** Tools like Accessibility Scanner, lint rules, or CI checks can catch common issues like contrast problems or missing labels, but cannot replace manual testing.

##### 3.16.5. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **All UI Components & Screens:** Accessibility is a cross-cutting concern. Every widget, screen, and user flow must be designed and implemented with accessibility in mind.
*   **Core Image Classification:** Results (text, disposal instructions) must be clearly announced. Buttons for actions must be accessible.
*   **Educational Content:** Text content must be readable, navigable. Images need alt text. Videos need captions/transcripts.
*   **Gamification:** Achievements, points, streaks, and leaderboard information must be accessible to screen readers. Visual cues for progress should have non-visual alternatives.
*   **Forms & Input Fields:** Proper labels, hints, and error messages for input fields.
*   **Notifications:** Notification content should be accessible when read by the system.
*   **Onboarding:** The onboarding experience itself must be accessible.

##### 3.16.6. User Benefits of Enhancements

*   **Usability for People with Disabilities:** Enables users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments to use the app effectively.
*   **Broader Audience Reach:** Makes the app available to a larger potential user base.
*   **Improved UX for All Users:** Many accessibility best practices (e.g., clear navigation, readable text, large touch targets) benefit all users.
*   **Legal Compliance (in some regions/contexts):** Adhering to accessibility standards can be a legal requirement.
*   **Enhanced Brand Reputation:** Demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity.

##### 3.16.7. Technical Considerations & Challenges for Enhancements

*   **Testing Effort:** Thorough accessibility testing across different platforms, devices, and assistive technologies is time-consuming.
*   **Developer Training:** Ensuring developers are knowledgeable about accessibility principles and Flutter's accessibility APIs.
*   **Custom UI Components:** Custom-drawn or highly interactive widgets require careful manual implementation of semantics.
*   **Dynamic Content:** Ensuring that dynamically changing content (e.g., search results, live data updates) is correctly announced to assistive technologies.
*   **Maintaining Accessibility:** Accessibility can regress if not continuously tested and considered during development of new features or UI changes.
*   **Platform Differences:** While Flutter abstracts many platform differences, some accessibility behaviors or APIs might vary slightly between iOS and Android.
*   **Performance of Semantics Tree:** Overly complex or deeply nested semantic trees could potentially impact performance, though this is rare with typical Flutter app structures.
*   **Balancing Aesthetics and Accessibility:** Sometimes design choices might conflict with accessibility needs (e.g., low-contrast color schemes). Accessibility should generally take precedence for core functionality.

### 3.17. Premium Features & Monetization

-   **Cross-reference UX/UI Analysis:** `docs/design/user_experience/app_ux_ui_analysis.md` (Home Screen mentions "View Premium Features" as a potential entry point. The overall UX analysis might also identify features that could be candidates for premium tiers).
-   **Cross-reference Planning:** `docs/planning/business/monetization/strategy.md` (If it exists, or this section would inform its creation).

##### 3.17.1. Current Functionality (Assumed None)

*   **No Monetization Implemented:** The app is likely free to use without any premium features, subscriptions, or in-app purchases.

##### 3.17.2. Data Sources & Dependencies

*   **User Profile (`UserProfile` in Firestore):**
    *   Store subscription status (e.g., `isPremiumUser: true/false`, `subscriptionTier: "gold"`, `subscriptionExpiryDate`).
    *   Store history of in-app purchases (if any).
*   **App Store Product Definitions:**
    *   Product IDs for subscriptions and in-app purchases need to be defined in Google Play Console and App Store Connect.
*   **Service(s) Utilized:**
    *   A `MonetizationService` or `BillingService` to handle:
        *   Fetching available products (subscriptions, IAPs) from the app stores.
        *   Initiating purchase flows.
        *   Verifying purchases with the app stores (client-side and server-side).
        *   Unlocking premium content/features for entitled users.
        *   Managing subscription status (checking for active subscriptions, handling renewals/cancellations).
    *   `CloudStorageService` or `UserAccountService` to update `UserProfile` with subscription status.
    *   Cloud Functions (for server-side receipt validation and secure entitlement management).
*   **External Dependencies (APIs, Libraries):**

### 3.18. User Behavior Analytics & Product Insights

-   **Cross-reference UX/UI Analysis:** Not directly a user-facing feature, but insights derived will heavily influence UX/UI decisions and feature prioritization across the entire app.
-   **Cross-reference Admin Panel:** The Admin Panel (3.12) would be a key consumer/displayer of these analytics.

##### 3.18.1. Current Functionality (Assumed Basic or None)

*   **Firebase Analytics (Likely Default):** If Firebase is used, basic event tracking (screen views, sessions) might be automatically collected by Firebase Analytics.
*   **No Custom Event Tracking (Likely):** Specific in-app user interactions (e.g., feature usage frequency, completion rates for challenges, interaction with educational content) are probably not yet tracked systematically.
*   **No Dedicated Analytics Dashboard (Beyond Firebase Console):** No tailored dashboard for product insights relevant to waste segregation behavior or app goals.

##### 3.18.2. Data Sources & Dependencies

*   **Primary Data Source:**
    *   **Firebase Analytics:** For collecting event data, user properties, and audience segmentation.
    *   **Firestore Data (Indirectly):** App data in Firestore (e.g., classification history, gamification progress) can be analyzed in aggregate (e.g., via BigQuery linked to Firebase) to derive deeper insights, but this is more advanced than standard Firebase Analytics event tracking.
*   **Data Models Involved:**
    *   No new app-facing data models, but a schema for custom events and user properties needs to be defined for Firebase Analytics.
*   **Service(s) Utilized:**
    *   `AnalyticsService` (or similar wrapper around Firebase Analytics SDK) to log custom events and set user properties.
    *   Firebase Analytics SDK (e.g., `firebase_analytics` Flutter plugin).
*   **External Dependencies (APIs, Libraries):**
    *   Firebase Analytics.
    *   Potentially Google BigQuery (for advanced data analysis if linking Firebase Analytics data).
    *   Data visualization tools (e.g., Google Data Studio, Looker, Tableau) if building custom dashboards.

##### 3.18.3. Potential Additional Functionality / Enhancements

*   **Comprehensive Custom Event Tracking:**
    *   **Core Actions:** Track classifications (successful, failed, by type), first-time feature use.
    *   **Gamification Engagement:** Track points earned (by source), badges unlocked, challenges started/completed/failed, leaderboard views, streak progression/breaks.
    *   **Educational Content Consumption:** Track articles viewed, videos watched, quizzes attempted/completed, content sharing.
    *   **User Journey Funnels:** Define and track key user flows (e.g., onboarding completion, first classification, first challenge completion, subscription conversion).
    *   **Search Usage:** Track search queries, no-result searches, click-through rates on search results.
    *   **Settings & Preferences:** Track changes to key settings (e.g., notification preferences, language).
    *   **Error/Frustration Points:** Track specific error occurrences (beyond crashes) or user actions that might indicate frustration (e.g., multiple failed attempts at a task).
*   **User Segmentation & Properties:**
    *   Define user properties (e.g., `user_tier` (free/premium), `engagement_level` (high/medium/low based on activity), `primary_interest` (e.g., composting, plastic reduction, based on onboarding or behavior)).
    *   Create audiences in Firebase Analytics based on these properties and event data for targeted analysis or campaigns.
*   **Product Insights Dashboard (in Admin Panel or dedicated tool):**
    *   Visualize Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to user engagement, retention, feature adoption, gamification effectiveness, and monetization.
    *   Track impact of new features or changes.
    *   Identify popular/unpopular content and features.
    *   Understand user drop-off points in key funnels.

### 3.19. Data Backup and Restore Strategy

-   **Cross-reference Admin Panel:** The Admin Panel (3.12) might have interfaces for initiating restores or monitoring backup status for certain types of data if manual intervention is ever needed.
-   **Cross-reference Firestore Schema:** `docs/technical/data_storage/firestore_schema.md` defines the data that needs backing up.

##### 3.19.1. Current Functionality (Assumed/Firebase Default)

*   **Firebase Firestore Automatic Backups (Point-in-Time Recovery - PITR):**
    *   Firestore offers continuous backups enabling Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) for the last 7 days (by default, can be configured up to 7 days for free tier, or longer with costs). This protects against accidental data deletion or corruption by allowing restoration to a specific microsecond within the retention window.
    *   This is a managed service by Google Cloud, requiring enablement but not manual backup execution for this timeframe.
*   **Firebase Authentication Data:** Managed by Firebase, highly available and resilient.
*   **Firebase Storage Data:** Data in Cloud Storage is highly durable and replicated across multiple availability zones by default. Versioning can be enabled for objects to protect against accidental overwrites or deletions.
*   **No Explicit Full Export/Long-Term Archival Strategy (Likely):** Beyond Firestore PITR, there might not be a defined strategy for regular full data exports for long-term archival or disaster recovery beyond Google Cloud's own regional resilience.

##### 3.19.2. Data Sources & Dependencies (Data to be Backed Up)

*   **Primary Firestore Database:**
    *   `users` (including `UserProfile`, `GamificationProfile`).
    *   `user_classifications`.
    *   `leaderboard_allTime` (and other leaderboard collections as they are created).
    *   `educational_content`.
    *   `challenges_definitions`, `achievements_definitions`.
    *   Any other collections storing application or user data.
*   **Firebase Storage:**
    *   User-uploaded images (profile pictures, classification images if stored long-term).
    *   Assets for educational content (images, videos) if hosted in Firebase Storage.
*   **Firebase Authentication User Data:** Managed by Firebase, but understanding how it relates to Firestore data is important for full recovery scenarios.
*   **Configuration Data:**
    *   Firebase Remote Config (can be versioned within Firebase).
    *   Any critical configurations stored elsewhere.

##### 3.19.3. Potential Additional Functionality / Enhancements

*   **Enable and Configure Firestore PITR:** Ensure PITR is enabled for the Firestore database and configure the retention window appropriately (e.g., 7 days or longer based on recovery needs and cost tolerance).
*   **Scheduled Firestore Exports to Cloud Storage (for Long-Term Archival/DR):**
    *   Implement scheduled exports of the entire Firestore database (or specific collections) to a separate Cloud Storage bucket.
    *   This provides backups beyond the PITR window and can be used for disaster recovery in a different region or for compliance/auditing purposes.
    *   These exports can be managed using `gcloud` commands or Cloud Functions triggered by Cloud Scheduler.
*   **Define Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO):**
    *   **RPO:** Maximum acceptable data loss. Influences backup frequency and PITR configuration.
    *   **RTO:** Maximum acceptable downtime to restore service. Influences restore procedures and infrastructure readiness.
*   **Documented Restore Procedures:**
    *   Detailed, step-by-step procedures for restoring Firestore from PITR.
    *   Procedures for restoring Firestore from a full export (if applicable).
    *   Procedures for restoring Firebase Storage objects (if versioning is used or if backups are needed).
    *   Considerations for re-linking Auth data with restored Firestore data if `userIds` are critical and there's a major incident.
*   **Regular Testing of Restore Procedures:** Periodically test restore procedures in a non-production environment to ensure they work and to identify any issues or gaps.
*   **Cross-Regional Backups (for DR):** For very high availability requirements, replicate exported backups to a Cloud Storage bucket in a different geographical region.
*   **Firebase Storage Object Versioning:** Enable versioning on Cloud Storage buckets holding critical user-uploaded content or app assets to easily recover from accidental deletions or overwrites.
*   **Monitoring Backup Success/Failures:** Set up alerts for failures in scheduled export jobs.
*   **Cost Management for Backups:** Monitor costs associated with PITR, Firestore exports, and Cloud Storage for backups.

##### 3.19.4. Alternative Approaches / Options Considered

*   **Relying Solely on Firestore PITR:** Sufficient for many common accidental deletion scenarios but may not cover all disaster recovery needs or long-term archival requirements (e.g., if data needs to be kept for years).
*   **Third-Party Backup Solutions for Firestore:** Some third-party tools offer backup services for Firestore. Evaluate if their features provide significant advantages over native GCP solutions for the cost.
*   **Manual Backups (Not Recommended):** Manually triggering exports is error-prone and unreliable for a production system.

##### 3.19.5. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **Admin Panel:** Could potentially have a section to monitor backup status or (with extreme caution and proper authorization) trigger certain types of data exports or view recovery logs.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Could include steps to ensure backup configurations are part of infrastructure-as-code or that test restores are periodically run.
*   **Data Deletion Requests (e.g., GDPR):** Backup policies need to consider how data deletion requests are handled in backups (e.g., data might persist in backups for a certain period, which should be communicated in the privacy policy).

##### 3.19.6. User Benefits of Enhancements (Indirect but Critical)

*   **Data Durability & Reliability:** Protects user data from accidental loss, corruption, or system failures.
*   **Service Availability:** Enables faster recovery in case of incidents, minimizing downtime.
*   **Trust & Confidence:** Users trust that their data is safe and the service is reliable.
*   **Business Continuity:** Ensures the app can recover from disasters and continue operating.

##### 3.19.7. Technical Considerations & Challenges for Enhancements

*   **Cost of Storage and Operations:** PITR, regular exports, and cross-region replication all have associated costs. Need to balance recovery needs with budget.
*   **Complexity of Restore Procedures:** Restoring a complex system with interdependencies (Firestore, Auth, Storage) can be challenging. Procedures must be well-documented and tested.
*   **Performance Impact of Exports:** Full Firestore exports can consume resources and potentially impact live database performance if not managed carefully (though managed exports are designed to minimize this).
*   **Security of Backups:** Ensure backups are stored securely with appropriate access controls (e.g., in a separate, locked-down GCP project or bucket).
*   **Testing Restore Scenarios:** Simulating realistic disaster scenarios for testing can be complex.
*   **Time to Restore (RTO):** Restoring large datasets can take time. Understand the RTO and ensure procedures can meet it.
*   **Data Consistency Across Services:** Ensuring consistency between Firestore, Auth, and Storage data after a restore, especially if restoring to an earlier point in time.
*   **Automating Backup and Restore Processes:** Setting up and maintaining automation for scheduled exports and monitoring.
*   **Compliance Requirements:** Understanding any legal or regulatory requirements for data retention and backup (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if applicable).

### 3.21. Overall Security Considerations

-   **Cross-reference Authentication System (3.7):** Foundation of user identity and access control.
-   **Cross-reference User Profile & Settings Management (3.6):** Privacy controls, account deletion.
-   **Cross-reference Admin Panel (3.12):** Secure access for administrative tasks.
-   **Cross-reference Data Backup and Restore (3.19):** Security of backups.
-   **Cross-reference CI/CD and DevOps Practices (3.20):** Secure handling of secrets and build artifacts.
-   **Cross-reference API Endpoints (Implicit with Cloud Functions/Backend):** Protection of backend services.

##### 3.21.1. Current Security Posture (Assumed)

*   **Firebase Security Rules (Firestore & Storage):** Basic rules are likely in place to protect data based on user authentication (`request.auth.uid`).
*   **HTTPS for Backend Communication:** Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Storage) use HTTPS by default.
*   **Platform-Level Security:** Relying on iOS and Android OS security features.
*   **Dependency Management:** Using `pubspec.yaml` for Flutter packages; regular updates might be manual.
*   **Limited Client-Side Protections:** May not have specific measures against client-side tampering beyond standard app store protections.

##### 3.21.2. Key Security Areas & Concerns

*   **Data Security:**
    *   **At Rest:** Firestore data is encrypted at rest by Google. Cloud Storage data is also encrypted at rest.
    *   **In Transit:** All communication with Firebase services is over HTTPS.
    *   **Firestore Security Rules:** Need to be comprehensive and rigorously tested to prevent unauthorized data access or modification. Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Cloud Storage Security Rules:** Similar to Firestore, ensure only authorized users can access/modify files.
    *   **Sensitive Data Handling:** Avoid storing unnecessary sensitive PII. If any sensitive data is stored (e.g., user email), ensure it's handled according to privacy best practices and regulations. For this app, most data is not highly sensitive, but user identity and gamification data should be protected.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Secure user authentication (as covered in 3.7).
    *   Proper authorization checks in Cloud Functions and Firestore rules.
    *   Protection against credential stuffing and brute-force attacks (Firebase Auth provides some protection).
*   **API Security (Cloud Functions / Backend Endpoints):**
    *   Ensure Cloud Functions are protected and can only be called by authenticated and authorized users/services.
    *   Input validation for all parameters to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
    *   Rate limiting to prevent abuse.
    *   Use Firebase App Check to ensure requests to backend services originate from authentic app instances.
*   **Client-Side Security (Flutter App):**
    *   **Code Obfuscation:** Flutter release builds include obfuscation by default, making reverse engineering harder.
    *   **Secure Local Storage:** If any sensitive data is cached locally (e.g., API keys, session tokens - though Firebase handles its own tokens securely), use secure storage mechanisms (e.g., `flutter_secure_storage`). Avoid storing sensitive data in shared preferences.
    *   **Protection Against Tampering:** While hard to prevent completely, techniques like checksum validation for critical code or data, or using App Check, can help.
    *   **SSL Pinning (Advanced):** For very high-security needs, consider SSL pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks against API communication, though this adds complexity and maintenance overhead.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Regularly update dependencies (Flutter packages, native dependencies) to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use tools to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   **Admin Panel Security:**
    *   Strong authentication for admin users (MFA recommended).
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit admin capabilities.
    *   Audit logs for admin actions.
    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF) if it's a web application.
*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   Securely store API keys, service account credentials, and other secrets. Do not hardcode them in client-side code. Use secure CI/CD variables, Google Secret Manager, or similar.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   Adhere to privacy policies and regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
    *   Anonymize data for analytics where possible.
    *   Provide users with control over their data (view, export, delete).
*   **Infrastructure Security (Firebase/GCP):**
    *   Leverage Google Cloud's security best practices.
    *   Securely configure Firebase projects (e.g., limit API key scope).

##### 3.21.3. Potential Additional Functionality / Enhancements

*   **Comprehensive Firestore/Storage Rules Review & Testing:** Regularly audit and test security rules using emulators or dedicated testing frameworks.
*   **Implement Firebase App Check:** Enforce that requests to Firebase backend services (Firestore, Functions, Storage) come from authentic instances of your app.
*   **Regular Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Periodically engage third-party security professionals to perform audits and penetration tests, especially as the app grows and handles more users/data.
*   **Automated Security Scans in CI/CD:** Integrate static (SAST) and dynamic (DAST) application security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:** Establish a policy for how security researchers can report vulnerabilities.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** Define a plan for how to respond to security incidents (e.g., data breach, service compromise).
*   **Enhanced Client-Side Protections (if deemed necessary):** Explore anti-tampering or anti-reverse engineering tools, but weigh benefits against complexity and potential for false positives.
*   **Developer Security Training:** Ensure developers are trained on secure coding practices.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Users:** Offer 2FA for app user accounts for increased security (as mentioned in Auth section).
*   **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for Admin Panel (if web-based):** Helps prevent XSS attacks.

##### 3.21.4. Alternative Approaches / Options Considered

*   **Relying Only on Default Firebase Security (Not Sufficient):** Firebase provides a secure foundation, but app-specific security rules, client-side considerations, and secure coding practices are the developer's responsibility.
*   **Overly Complex Client-Side Protections:** Can sometimes provide a false sense of security and may be bypassed by determined attackers, while adding significant development overhead.

##### 3.21.5. Integration Points with Other Features

*   **Security is a cross-cutting concern, impacting every feature and component.**
*   **Authentication System:** Core to user-based security.
*   **Cloud Functions (Backend Logic):** Must be secured against unauthorized access and malicious inputs.
*   **Data Storage (Firestore, Storage):** Security rules are paramount.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Securely manages secrets, runs security scans.
*   **Admin Panel:** Requires its own robust security measures.

##### 3.21.6. User Benefits of Enhancements

*   **Protection of Personal Data:** Ensures user information is kept safe and private.
*   **Trust and Confidence:** Users feel more secure using an app that prioritizes security.
*   **Reduced Risk of Account Takeover or Data Breach:** Strong security measures protect against malicious actors.
*   **App Integrity:** Helps ensure the app functions as intended without unauthorized interference.

##### 3.21.7. Technical Considerations & Challenges for Enhancements

*   **Complexity of Security Rules:** Writing and maintaining comprehensive and accurate Firestore/Storage security rules can be challenging.
*   **Balancing Security with Usability:** Overly restrictive security measures can sometimes negatively impact user experience.
*   **Keeping Up with New Threats:** The security landscape is constantly evolving; requires ongoing vigilance and updates.
*   **Cost of Security Tools and Services:** Penetration testing, advanced security tools, or third-party audits can be expensive.
*   **Performance Impact of Some Security Measures:** Certain client-side checks or intensive server-side validations could potentially add overhead if not implemented efficiently.
*   **False Positives from Security Scans:** Automated tools can sometimes flag non-issues, requiring manual review.
*   **Secure Development Lifecycle:** Integrating security into all phases of development, not just as an afterthought.
*   **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Ensuring security measures are applied consistently across Android, iOS, and any web components (like an admin panel).
