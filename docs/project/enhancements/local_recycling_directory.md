# Local Recycling Directory Feature Specification

## Overview

The Local Recycling Directory is a feature designed to bridge the gap between waste classification and actual disposal by providing users with a comprehensive, searchable directory of local waste management resources. This feature will help users find appropriate disposal locations for various waste types, particularly focusing on specialized items like e-waste, hazardous materials, and recyclables that require specific handling.

## 1. Feature Description

### 1.1 Core Functionality

The Local Recycling Directory will:

1. Provide an interactive map showing nearby waste management facilities
2. Allow searching and filtering by waste type and facility features
3. Display detailed information about each facility (hours, accepted materials, etc.)
4. Enable users to add missing locations subject to verification
5. Include user reviews and tips for each location
6. Offer offline access to previously viewed locations
7. Integrate with the waste classification flow to suggest relevant disposal options

### 1.2 User Benefits

- **Immediate Action Guidance**: Bridges the gap between "what is this waste?" and "where do I take it?"
- **Local Relevance**: Focuses on resources available in the user's specific location
- **Community Contribution**: Leverages local knowledge through community-sourced locations
- **Practical Application**: Makes waste segregation knowledge immediately actionable
- **Specialized Waste Solutions**: Particularly valuable for hard-to-recycle items that can't go in regular bins

- **Verification Accuracy**: Accuracy of community-verified facilities
- **Completion Rate**: Users who follow through from classification to disposal
- **Retention Impact**: Effect on overall app retention and engagement

## 8. Conclusion

The Local Recycling Directory transforms the Waste Segregation App from an informational tool into an action-oriented solution. By connecting waste identification with local disposal options, it provides immediate practical value to users and creates a stronger connection between knowledge and environmental action.

This feature directly addresses the common user question "Now that I know what this is, where do I take it?" - completing the waste management journey from identification to proper disposal.
