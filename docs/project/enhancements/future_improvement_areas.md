# Future Improvement Areas & Planning Roadmap

This document outlines potential areas for significant improvement and future planning within the Waste Segregation App. These areas were identified after completing initial detailed planning for the Admin Panel and Phase 1 Gamification.

## 1. Core Image Classification User Experience & Feedback Loop

*   **Current Status Summary:**
    *   Basic image classification flow is defined (capture/upload -> AI analysis -> result display).
    *   Tiered AI model approach (OpenAI, Gemini) is in place.
    *   Mentions of "Human Review" for low confidence and a "User Feedback/Correction" leading to a "Learning Loop/Model Update" exist in documentation (`ai_classification_system.md`, `advanced_ai_image_features.md`).
*   **Key Areas for Detailed Planning & Improvement:**
    *   **User-Initiated Corrections:**
        *   Detailed UI/UX for users to report misclassifications (e.g., select correct category, suggest material, type item name).
        *   Structured data model for storing user feedback (e.g., `original_classification_id`, `user_provided_category`, `user_notes`, `timestamp`).
    *   **Admin Panel - Feedback Review & Management:**
        *   Dedicated interface in the Admin Panel to efficiently review, categorize, and prioritize user-submitted corrections.
        *   Tools to identify frequently misclassified items or common user correction patterns.
    *   **Closing the "Learning Loop" - Improving the AI:**
        *   Strategy for using aggregated user feedback to refine prompts for LLM-based classification.
        *   Process for identifying items that consistently challenge the AI, potentially leading to targeted data augmentation or specific handling rules.
        *   (Future) Mechanism for fine-tuning custom models or providing structured feedback to AI providers if their APIs support it.
    *   **Communicating and Handling AI Uncertainty:**
        *   Clearer UI for when AI confidence is low.
        *   User options when faced with low-confidence results (e.g., "Help us improve by providing more details," "Proceed with caution," "Request manual review" - if feasible).
