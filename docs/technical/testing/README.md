## Main File

## Recent UI and Error Handling Improvements

- **UI Text Overflow Fixes**: The result screen and educational content screens now use `TextOverflow.ellipsis` and `maxLines` to prevent text clipping and improve accessibility. See `result_screen.dart` and `content_detail_screen.dart`.
- **Media Rendering**: Educational content detail screens now render videos using a video player and infographics using `Image.network`, with error/fallback handling for missing or broken media links.
- **Web Camera Access**: The app now uses `image_picker` and `image_picker_for_web` to enable camera capture in the browser, with graceful fallback for unsupported browsers. See `web_camera_access.dart` for details.
- **Centralized Error Handling**: All major screens now use a centralized `ErrorHandler` and `AppException` pattern for consistent error logging and user feedback. See `constants.dart` for the error handling implementation.
