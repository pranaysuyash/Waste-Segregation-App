## Next Steps Recommended

### Immediate Actions (High Impact)
1. **Fix Missing Await Statements**
   - Target: auth_screen.dart navigation calls
   - Target: settings_screen.dart async operations
   - Expected reduction: 10-15 issues

2. **Resolve BuildContext Issues**
   - Add proper mounted checks
   - Use context safely across async boundaries
   - Expected reduction: 8-10 issues

### Medium-term Actions
1. **Clean Up Unused Code**
   - Remove unused methods and fields
   - Consolidate duplicate functionality
   - Expected reduction: 15-20 issues

2. **Optimize Imports**
   - Remove unnecessary imports
   - Organize import statements
   - Expected reduction: 3-5 issues

## Technical Approach

### Systematic Resolution Strategy
1. **Error Prevention First**: Avoid creating new errors while fixing existing ones
2. **High-Impact Focus**: Prioritize issues that affect functionality over style
3. **Incremental Progress**: Make small, verifiable improvements
4. **Documentation**: Track all changes for maintainability

### Tools and Methods Used
- Flutter analyze for comprehensive issue detection
- Targeted search and replace operations
- Git version control for safe rollbacks
- Systematic file-by-file approach

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- ✅ Targeted fixes for specific issue types
- ✅ Proper git workflow with rollback capability
- ✅ Focus on high-impact issues first
- ✅ Systematic documentation of progress

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Mass automated changes without verification
- ❌ Adding variables/code without checking usage
- ❌ Fixing too many different issue types simultaneously
- ❌ Making changes without understanding context
