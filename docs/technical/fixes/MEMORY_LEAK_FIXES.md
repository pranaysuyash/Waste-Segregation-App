# Memory Leak Fixes

## Overview
This document tracks memory leak fixes implemented in the WasteWise application to improve stability and performance.

## HistoryScreen Memory Leak Fix (June 3, 2025)

### Issue Description
The HistoryScreen was experiencing critical memory leaks due to `setState()` being called after the widget was disposed. This occurred when users navigated away from the screen while async operations were still in progress.

**Error Message:**
```
Platform Error Captured: setState() called after dispose(): _HistoryScreenState#dcf9f(lifecycle state: defunct, not mounted)
This error happens if you call setState() on a State object for a widget that no longer appears in the widget tree
```

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by async operations in the following methods completing after the widget was disposed:
- `_loadClassifications()` - Loading classification data from storage/cloud
- `_loadMoreClassifications()` - Pagination loading
- `_exportToCSV()` - CSV export functionality

### Solution Implemented
Added comprehensive `mounted` checks before all `setState()` calls in async methods:

#### 1. _loadMoreClassifications() Method
```dart
// Before fix - no mounted checks
Future<void> _loadMoreClassifications() async {
  if (_isLoadingMore || !_hasMorePages) return;
  
  setState(() {
    _isLoadingMore = true;
  });
  
  try {
    // async operations...
    setState(() {
      // update state
    });
  } catch (e) {
    _showErrorSnackBar('Failed to load more classifications: $e');
  } finally {
    setState(() {
      _isLoadingMore = false;
    });
  }
}

// After fix - with mounted checks
Future<void> _loadMoreClassifications() async {
  if (_isLoadingMore || !_hasMorePages || !mounted) return;
  
  setState(() {
    _isLoadingMore = true;
  });
  
  try {
    // async operations...
    
    if (!mounted) return;
    
    setState(() {
      // update state
    });
  } catch (e) {
    if (mounted) {
      _showErrorSnackBar('Failed to load more classifications: $e');
    }
  } finally {
    if (mounted) {
      setState(() {
        _isLoadingMore = false;
      });
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. _exportToCSV() Method
```dart
// Added mounted checks at key points:
Future<void> _exportToCSV() async {
  if (!mounted) return;
  
  try {
    setState(() {
      _isLoading = true;
    });
    
    // async operations...
    
    if (!mounted) return;
    
    // more async operations...
    
    if (!mounted) return;
    
    // final operations...
  } catch (e) {
    if (mounted) {
      _showErrorSnackBar('Failed to export classifications: $e');
    }
  } finally {
    if (mounted) {
      setState(() {
        _isLoading = false;
      });
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Principles Applied

1. **Early Return Pattern**: Check `mounted` at the beginning of async methods
2. **Post-Async Checks**: Check `mounted` after each significant async operation
3. **Conditional setState**: Wrap all `setState()` calls with `if (mounted)` checks
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure error handling also respects the mounted state
5. **Finally Block Protection**: Protect cleanup operations in finally blocks

### Testing Strategy
While comprehensive unit tests couldn't be run due to compilation issues with test mocks, the fixes follow Flutter best practices for preventing memory leaks:

- **Mounted Checks**: Standard Flutter pattern for async operations
- **Early Returns**: Prevent unnecessary work on disposed widgets
- **Conditional Updates**: Only update state when widget is still active

### Impact
- **Stability**: Eliminates `setState() called after dispose()` errors
- **Performance**: Prevents unnecessary state updates on disposed widgets
- **Memory**: Reduces memory leaks from retained references
- **User Experience**: Smoother navigation without crashes

### Commit Reference
- Commit: `5d157b6` - "Fix memory leak in HistoryScreen: Add mounted checks to prevent setState after dispose"

### Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Always check `mounted`** before calling `setState()` in async methods
2. **Add mounted checks** after significant async operations
3. **Use early returns** to avoid unnecessary processing on disposed widgets
4. **Protect error handling** with mounted checks
5. **Test navigation scenarios** where users might leave screens during async operations

### Monitoring
Monitor app logs for any remaining `setState() called after dispose()` errors. If found, apply the same pattern of mounted checks to the affected widgets.

## Future Considerations

### Additional Screens to Review
Consider applying similar patterns to other screens with async operations:
- `ImageCaptureScreen` - Camera operations
- `ResultScreen` - AI analysis operations  
- `SettingsScreen` - Settings save operations
- `AuthScreen` - Authentication operations

### Automated Testing
Once test compilation issues are resolved, implement automated tests for:
- Rapid navigation scenarios
- Async operation cancellation
- Memory leak detection
- Widget lifecycle management
