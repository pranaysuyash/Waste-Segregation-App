# AI-Powered Image Segmentation Enhancements

This document outlines advanced AI-powered image segmentation strategies for the Waste Segregation App, focusing on improving accuracy, handling complex waste items, and enabling real-time segmentation for a more intuitive classification experience.

## 1. Overview

Image segmentation is a critical component of the Waste Segregation App, allowing users to identify individual waste items within images containing multiple objects. By enhancing the AI segmentation capabilities, the app can provide more precise classifications, handle complex mixed-waste scenarios, and create a more interactive user experience.

## 2. Current Implementation Status (Updated May 2025)

Based on the video demo review, the current implementation status of segmentation features is:

- **UI Placeholder Implemented**: 
  - Toggle switch for "Segment" mode in the analyze image screen
  - 3x3 grid overlay appears when toggle is enabled
  - User can presumably select grid segments (though not demonstrated in the demo)

- **Missing Functionality**:
  - Actual segmentation processing with SAM/GluonCV
  - Interactive object selection
  - Multi-object classification
  - Handling of complex scenes with multiple objects

- **Issues Identified in Demo**:
  - AI classification inconsistency for complex scenes (basket of toys yielded different results in three attempts)
  - No visible segmentation happening despite UI elements being present
  - The toggle is present but was not used effectively in the demo flow

## 3. Key Objectives

- **Improve Segmentation Accuracy**: Implement state-of-the-art AI models for precise object boundaries
- **Enable Multi-Item Detection**: Support identification and classification of multiple waste items in a single image
- **Reduce Processing Time**: Optimize models for mobile performance and lower latency
- **Support Offline Operation**: Enable on-device segmentation for offline scenarios
- **Enhance User Interaction**: Create interactive segmentation with user feedback
- **Ensure Privacy**: Process sensitive images locally without cloud transmission

## 4. Advanced Segmentation Architectures

### 4.1 Model Selection

**Primary Segmentation Models**:
- **Segment Anything Model (SAM) Lite**: Mobile-optimized version of Meta's SAM
- **MobileViT-Seg**: Lightweight vision transformer for edge devices
- **DeepLabv3+ Mobile**: Optimized atrous convolution for mobile devices
- **EfficientSeg**: Efficient encoder-decoder architecture for real-time segmentation

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Tiered model selection based on device capabilities
- Combination of detection and segmentation models for optimal performance
- Specialized models for challenging waste categories (e.g., transparent plastics)

### 4.2 Model Architecture Overview

The segmentation system uses a hybrid architecture that selects the appropriate model based on device capabilities, image complexity, and whether the app is operating online or offline:

```
SegmentationManager:
  - Detects device capabilities (CPU, GPU, NPU availability)
  - Selects appropriate model based on capabilities
  - Routes segmentation request to selected model
  - Post-processes results for UI presentation

ModelSelector:
  - if device has Neural Engine or GPU:
    - Use SAM Lite for high-precision segmentation
  - else if device has mid-range capabilities:
    - Use MobileViT-Seg for balanced performance
  - else:
    - Use EfficientSeg for basic segmentation
  - For offline mode:
    - Always select most compact model (EfficientSeg)
```

## 5. Multi-Item Waste Detection

### 5.1 Detection Pipeline

The multi-item detection pipeline enables the app to identify multiple waste objects in a single image:

1. **Initial Detection**: Run lightweight object detector to identify potential waste items
2. **Segmentation**: Apply segmentation model to extract precise masks for each detected item
3. **Classification**: Classify each segmented item individually
4. **User Verification**: Allow user to confirm or adjust segmentations

**Detection Strategy**:
- Single-shot detection for initial object identification
- Confidence thresholding to filter out uncertain detections
- Non-maximum suppression to handle overlapping items
- Instance segmentation to separate touching objects

### 5.2 Complex Scenario Handling

**Mixed Waste Processing**:
- Processing pipeline for images with multiple waste types
- Segmentation refinement for overlapping items
- Component separation for multi-material items

**Example Processing Flow**:
```
Input: Image with multiple waste items
Output: List of segmented items with classifications

1. Pre-process image (resize, normalize)
2. Run object detection to get bounding boxes
3. For each bounding box:
   a. Run segmentation model to get precise mask
   b. Extract masked region from original image
   c. Pass masked region to classification model
4. Apply post-processing to resolve overlaps
5. Present results to user with confidence scores
```
