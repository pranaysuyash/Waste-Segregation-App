## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Decisions**

### **ADR-001: Flutter Framework Selection** *(October 2024)*
**Decision**: Use Flutter for cross-platform mobile development
**Context**: Need to deploy to both iOS and Android with limited development resources
**Rationale**: 
- Single codebase for both platforms reduces development time by 60%
- Strong community support for camera/ML integration
- Excellent performance for image processing workflows
- Good accessibility support with semantic widgets
**Consequences**: 
- ‚úÖ Faster development cycle
- ‚úÖ Consistent UX across platforms  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some platform-specific features require additional work
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Larger app size compared to native

### **ADR-002: AI/ML Integration Strategy** *(October 2024)*
**Decision**: External API for waste classification vs. on-device ML
**Context**: Need accurate waste classification with reasonable performance
**Rationale**:
- External API provides higher accuracy (95%+ vs. 80% on-device)
- Easier to update and improve classification without app updates
- Reduced app size and battery usage
- Can leverage server-side optimizations
**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Higher classification accuracy
- ‚úÖ Easier model improvements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires internet connection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API costs scale with usage

### **ADR-003: State Management with Provider** *(November 2024)*
**Decision**: Use Provider pattern for state management
**Context**: Need consistent state across screens with moderate complexity
**Rationale**:
- Simpler than Redux/Bloc for current app complexity
- Good performance for current use cases
- Easy to test and debug
- Native Flutter integration
**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Simple implementation and maintenance
- ‚úÖ Good performance for current needs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May need migration to Bloc if complexity increases

### **ADR-004: Mapping Solution Selection** *(January 2025)*
**Decision**: Use `flutter_map` with OpenStreetMap (OSM) as the primary mapping solution, replacing any consideration for proprietary services like Google Maps.
**Context**: The app requires a scalable, cost-effective, and highly performant mapping solution to display thousands of waste disposal facilities, support offline use, and enable advanced geospatial features like heat maps and clustering.
**Rationale**:
- **Cost-Effective**: `flutter_map` and OSM are free, eliminating API call costs that would be substantial at scale with services like Google Maps ($7/1,000 loads). This is critical for a publicly-focused or municipally-deployed application.
- **High Performance**: Superior performance in handling large marker datasets (10,000+), maintaining 60fps and consuming less memory (15-25MB vs 25-40MB for Google Maps).
- **Offline Capability**: Excellent plugin support (`flutter_map_tile_caching`) enables robust offline functionality, which is essential for users in areas with poor connectivity.
- **Customization & Control**: Provides complete control over map styling and data without restrictive licensing, allowing for a deeply integrated and branded user experience.
- **Rich Plugin Ecosystem**: Leverages a strong ecosystem for clustering (`flutter_map_marker_cluster`), heatmaps (`flutter_map_heatmap`), and Firestore geospatial queries (`geoflutterfire_plus`).
**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Significant cost savings at scale.
- ‚úÖ Superior performance and user experience, especially in data-dense areas.
- ‚úÖ Full offline functionality for core mapping features.
- ‚úÖ Avoids vendor lock-in and restrictive licensing terms.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires managing a slightly more complex stack of open-source plugins compared to a single provider solution.
- ‚û°Ô∏è **Detailed technical implementation is documented in [Mapping Solution Architecture](docs/technical/architecture/mapping_solution_architecture.md).**
