# Unified Architecture Documentation

This directory contains a consolidated view of the Waste Segregation App's technical architecture, bringing together previously separate documentation about different aspects of the system architecture into a cohesive, comprehensive resource.

## Files in this Directory

- [`comprehensive_architecture.md`](./comprehensive_architecture.md): The primary document providing a complete overview of the app's technical architecture, classification pipeline, AI/ML strategy, and implementation details.

## Purpose of Consolidation

The architecture documentation was previously spread across multiple files in different directories:

- `/docs/technical/architecture/classification_pipeline.md`
- `/docs/technical/system_architecture/technical_architecture.md`
- Various AI strategy documents

This consolidation:

1. Eliminates duplication and redundancy
2. Ensures consistency between architectural descriptions
3. Provides a single source of truth for architecture documentation
4. Makes it easier to understand the full system architecture without jumping between documents

## Using This Documentation

This comprehensive architecture document should be the primary reference for understanding the overall system design. The original files remain available for historical reference but may contain outdated information.

When making architecture decisions or implementing new features, always refer to this unified documentation to ensure consistency with the overall design vision.

## Contributing to Architecture Documentation

When updating architecture documentation:

1. Always update the unified comprehensive document in this directory
2. Add appropriate cross-references to any detailed design documents
3. Ensure consistency between high-level architecture and detailed implementations
