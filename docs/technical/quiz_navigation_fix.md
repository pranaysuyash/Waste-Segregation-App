# Educational Content Navigation Fix

**Date:** 2025-05-24  
**Version:** 0.1.4+96  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

## 🚨 **Problem Description**

Users reported that when clicking "Learn More" from the classification result screen, educational content (quizzes, articles, videos, infographics, tutorials) was limited or missing - showing only headers or "No content found" messages.

### **User Experience Issue**
- ✅ **From Homepage**: All educational content worked perfectly
- ❌ **From "Learn More" button**: Limited or missing content across all educational types (articles, videos, infographics, quizzes, tutorials)

### **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was in the educational content categorization system:

1. **Classification Results**: When users classify waste, they get categories like:
   - `'Wet Waste'`
   - `'Dry Waste'` 
   - `'Hazardous Waste'`

2. **"Learn More" Navigation**: The result screen passes the specific waste category to `EducationalContentScreen`:
   ```dart
   EducationalContentScreen(
     initialCategory: widget.classification.category, // e.g., "Wet Waste"
   )
   ```

3. **Quiz Content Filtering**: The educational content screen filters content by category, but the original quiz was only categorized as:
   ```dart
   categories: ['General', 'Recycling']  // ❌ Missing specific waste categories
   ```

4. **Result**: When filtering for `'Wet Waste'` content, no quizzes were found because none were categorized under specific waste types.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Updated Existing Quiz Categories**
```dart
// Before
categories: ['General', 'Recycling']

// After  
categories: ['General', 'Recycling', 'Wet Waste', 'Dry Waste', 'Hazardous Waste']
```

### **2. Added Category-Specific Quizzes**

Created dedicated quizzes for each major waste category:

#### **Wet Waste Quiz** (`quiz2`)
- **Title**: "Wet Waste and Composting Quiz"
- **Categories**: `['Wet Waste', 'Composting']`
- **Questions**: 4 questions about composting, organic waste management
- **Topics**: Compostable materials, carbon/nitrogen ratios, composting maintenance

#### **Dry Waste Quiz** (`quiz3`)
- **Title**: "Dry Waste and Recycling Quiz" 
- **Categories**: `['Dry Waste', 'Recycling']`
- **Questions**: 4 questions about recycling, plastic codes, paper recycling
- **Topics**: Plastic recycling codes, glass recycling, cardboard preparation

#### **Hazardous Waste Quiz** (`quiz4`)
- **Title**: "Hazardous Waste Safety Quiz"
- **Categories**: `['Hazardous Waste', 'E-waste']`
- **Questions**: 4 questions about safe disposal of hazardous materials
- **Topics**: Battery disposal, e-waste handling, paint disposal, data security

## 🧪 **Testing & Verification**

### **Test Coverage**
Created comprehensive test suite in `test/quiz_navigation_fix_test.dart`:

```dart
test('should handle educational content screen navigation scenario', () {
  const initialCategory = 'Wet Waste';
  
  // Simulate "Learn More" navigation filtering
  var filteredContent = educationalService.getContentByType(ContentType.quiz);
  filteredContent = filteredContent
      .where((content) => content.categories.contains(initialCategory))
      .toList();
  
  expect(filteredContent.isNotEmpty, true);
});
```

### **Test Results**

   - Test Your Recycling Knowledge
