# Statistics Display Bug Fix

## Issue Description

The achievements screen was displaying inconsistent statistics data:
- **Items Identified**: Showed 1
- **Wet Waste**: Showed 10 items  
- **Total Points**: Showed 60

This created a confusing user experience where the individual category counts didn't match the overall count.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in how the statistics were calculated and displayed:

1. **Data Storage**: The `categoryPoints` field in the `UserPoints` model stores **points**, not item counts
2. **Point System**: Each item classification awards 10 points
3. **Display Logic**: 
   - The overall "Items Identified" was correctly converting points to items by dividing by 10
   - The individual category displays were incorrectly showing the raw points as item counts

## Technical Details

### Before Fix

```dart
// In achievements_screen.dart - Category display section
final count = entry.value; // This was showing points (100)
Text('$count items') // Displayed "100 items" instead of "10 items"

// In _getTotalItemsIdentified function
int total = 0;
for (final entry in profile.points.categoryPoints.entries) {
  total += entry.value; // This was summing points, not items
}
```

### After Fix

```dart
// In achievements_screen.dart - Category display section
final points = entry.value;
final itemCount = (points / 10).round(); // Convert points to items
Text('$itemCount items') // Now correctly displays "10 items"

// In _getTotalItemsIdentified function
int total = 0;
for (final entry in profile.points.categoryPoints.entries) {
  total += (entry.value / 10).round(); // Convert points back to item count
}
```

## Changes Made

### File: `lib/screens/achievements_screen.dart`

1. **Category Display Fix** (Line ~1015):
   - Changed variable name from `count` to `points` for clarity
   - Added conversion: `final itemCount = (points / 10).round()`
   - Updated display text to use `itemCount` instead of raw points

2. **Total Items Calculation** (Line ~1320):
   - Already had the correct fix implemented
   - Verified that `_getTotalItemsIdentified` properly converts points to items

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive tests in `test/stats_fix_test.dart`:

- **Basic conversion test**: Verifies points-to-items conversion works correctly
- **Edge case handling**: Tests rounding behavior with partial points
- **Empty data handling**: Ensures zero items display for empty category points

All tests pass successfully.

## Data Consistency

The fix ensures:
- **Overall "Items Identified"**: Correctly shows total items across all categories
- **Individual categories**: Each category shows correct item count (points ÷ 10)
- **Total points**: Remains unchanged and shows cumulative points earned
- **Mathematical consistency**: Sum of individual category items = total items identified

## Example Data Flow

With 10 wet waste items classified:

```
Data Storage:
- categoryPoints['Wet Waste'] = 100 (10 items × 10 points each)

Display Logic:
- Category display: (100 ÷ 10).round() = 10 items ✓
- Overall total: Sum of all (points ÷ 10) = 10 items ✓
- Total points: 100 points ✓
```

## Validation

The fix has been validated through:
1. Unit tests covering various scenarios
2. Code review of all uses of `categoryPoints.entries`
3. Verification that no other parts of the app are affected

## Impact

This fix resolves the user confusion about inconsistent statistics and ensures:
- Accurate progress tracking
- Consistent user experience
- Proper gamification feedback
- Reliable achievement calculations

## Future Considerations

To prevent similar issues:
1. Consider adding type safety with dedicated `ItemCount` and `Points` types
2. Add validation methods to ensure data consistency
3. Include integration tests for statistics display
4. Document the points system clearly in code comments
