# Firebase Integration Summary - COMPLETED

The Firebase SDK has been successfully integrated into the Waste Segregation App, and Google Sign-In authentication is now fully functional. This document summarizes the implemented changes.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Project-level build.gradle

Added Google services plugin to the project-level build.gradle file:

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        // Add the Google services Gradle plugin
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.2'
    }
}

plugins {
    // Add the dependency for the Google services Gradle plugin
    id 'com.google.gms.google-services' version '4.4.2' apply false
}
```

### 2. App-level build.gradle

Applied the Google services plugin and added Firebase dependencies:

```gradle
plugins {
    id "com.android.application"
    id "kotlin-android"
    // The Flutter Gradle Plugin must be applied after the Android and Kotlin Gradle plugins.
    id "dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin"
    // Add the Google services Gradle plugin
    id "com.google.gms.google-services"
}

// Updated minSdk for Firebase Auth compatibility
defaultConfig {
    minSdk = 23 // Updated for Firebase Auth which requires minSdk 23
}

dependencies {
    // Import the Firebase BoM with a version compatible with our Kotlin version
    implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:32.7.2')

    // Add the dependencies for Firebase products you want to use
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics'
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth'
}
```

### 3. google-services.json

The google-services.json file has been updated with the SHA-1 fingerprint, and Google Sign-In has been successfully configured in the Firebase console.

### 4. AndroidManifest.xml

Added the enableOnBackInvokedCallback attribute to silence Android 14 back button warnings:

```xml
<application
    android:label="waste_segregation_app"
    android:name="${applicationName}"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true">
```

### 5. UI Improvements

Fixed the RenderFlex overflow issue in classification_card.dart by wrapping the action buttons Row with a SingleChildScrollView:

```dart
// Action buttons
if (onShare != null || onSave != null)
  SingleChildScrollView(
    scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
    child: Row(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,
      children: [
        // Button widgets
      ],
    ),
  ),
```

### 6. Type Handling

Updated waste_classification.dart and ai_service.dart to properly handle type conversion for recyclingCode, fixing the 'int' not being a subtype of 'String?' error.

## Authentication Status

âœ… **Google Sign-In is now fully functional**:
- SHA-1 fingerprint has been added to the Firebase project
- Google Sign-In has been enabled as an authentication provider
- The updated google-services.json file has been integrated
- Authentication flow has been successfully tested and is working properly

## Maintenance Instructions

For future changes related to Firebase:

1. **Adding New Devices or Release Builds**:
   - Generate the SHA fingerprint for the new device/build
   - Add it to Firebase console
   - Download the updated google-services.json file

2. **Updating Firebase Dependencies**:
   - Ensure the Firebase BoM version is compatible with your Kotlin version
   - Update dependencies in the app-level build.gradle file
   - Test authentication after any updates

3. **SDK Version Compatibility**:
   - Maintain minSdk at 23 or higher for Firebase Auth
   - Ensure compileSdk is properly set (currently 35)
   - Keep Kotlin and Java versions compatible (currently using Java 17)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:
- Verify SHA fingerprints are correctly added to Firebase
- Ensure Google Sign-in is enabled in Firebase Authentication
- Check that the latest google-services.json file is in the project
- Verify internet connectivity and Google Play Services on the device
