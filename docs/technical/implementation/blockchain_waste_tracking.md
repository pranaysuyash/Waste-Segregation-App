# Blockchain Waste Tracking System

This document outlines the integration of blockchain technology into the Waste Segregation App to create transparent, verifiable tracking of waste materials from classification through processing and recycling.

## 1. Overview

Blockchain technology can transform waste management by creating immutable records of waste classification, collection, and processing. This system creates trust in the recycling process, enables verification of proper waste handling, and provides a foundation for carbon credits and sustainability reporting.

## 2. Market Opportunity

The integration of blockchain in waste management is an emerging trend for 2025, with industry analysts identifying transparency and traceability as key drivers of innovation in the sector. Companies and municipalities are increasingly seeking verifiable data for ESG reporting and regulatory compliance.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Blockchain Selection

The system will use a **permissioned blockchain** with these characteristics:

- **Energy Efficiency**: Low energy consumption compared to proof-of-work chains
- **Transaction Speed**: Capable of handling high transaction volumes
- **Scalability**: Ability to scale as user base grows
- **Smart Contract Support**: For automated verification and tokenization

Recommended options include Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, or a Layer 2 solution on Ethereum.

### 3.2 Data Structure

Each waste classification event will generate a blockchain record with:

```json
{
  "wasteEventId": "unique-identifier",
  "userId": "anonymized-user-identifier",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-12T14:30:00Z",
  "location": {
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194,
    "accuracy": 10,
    "regionCode": "US-CA-SF"
  },
  "classification": {
    "category": "recyclable",
    "subcategory": "plastic",
    "material": "PET",
