This document outlines different implementation approaches for key components of the waste segregation application. Each section discusses technology options, their pros and cons, and recommendations based on different requirements and constraints.

## 1. Image Segmentation Options

### Option 1: Facebook's Segment Anything Model (SAM)

**Implementation Approach:**
- Implement Meta's state-of-the-art Segment Anything Model (SAM)
- Provide both automatic segmentation and interactive refinement options
- Offer server-side and on-device deployment paths

**Technologies:**
- Meta's SAM model (vit_b or vit_h variants)
- PyTorch for server-side implementation
- PyTorch Mobile or ONNX Runtime for on-device

**Pros:**
- State-of-the-art segmentation quality
- Both automatic and interactive segmentation modes
- Highly accurate object boundaries
- Zero-shot performance on unseen objects
- Handles complex overlapping waste items
- Excellent at separating waste from backgrounds
- Very robust to image quality variations

**Cons:**
- Larger model size (vit_b: ~375MB, can be quantized)
- More computationally intensive
- May require server deployment for full-quality results
- Higher latency compared to lightweight models

**Example Implementation (Server-side):**
```python
from segment_anything import SamPredictor, SamAutomaticMaskGenerator, sam_model_registry

# Load model (once at startup)
sam = sam_model_registry["vit_b"](checkpoint="sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth").to(device)
mask_generator = SamAutomaticMaskGenerator(
    sam,
    points_per_side=32,
    pred_iou_thresh=0.9,
    stability_score_thresh=0.95,
)

# Automatic segmentation of all objects
def segment_image(image):
    masks = mask_generator.generate(image)
    # Filter masks by size if needed
    return [m["segmentation"] for m in masks if m["area"] > 1500]

# Or interactive segmentation with clicks/prompts
def segment_with_prompts(image, points, labels):
    predictor = SamPredictor(sam)
    predictor.set_image(image)
    masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(
        point_coords=points,
        point_labels=labels,
        multimask_output=True
    )
    return masks
```

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Stack(
      children: [
        // Display image
        Image.memory(widget.imageBytes),
        
        // Overlay mask with transparency
        if (widget.initialMask != null)
          CustomPaint(
            painter: MaskPainter(widget.initialMask),
          ),
        
        // Interactive drawing layer
        GestureDetector(
          onPanUpdate: (details) {
            setState(() {
              _points.add(details.localPosition);
              _pointLabels.add(_isAddingForeground);
            });
            
            _updateMask();
          },
        ),
        
        // Tool controls
        Positioned(
          bottom: 16,
          child: Row(
            children: [
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.add),
                onPressed: () => setState(() => _isAddingForeground = true),
              ),
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.remove),
                onPressed: () => setState(() => _isAddingForeground = false),
              ),
              IconButton(
                icon: Icon(Icons.refresh),
                onPressed: _resetPoints,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
  
  void _updateMask() {
    // Call SAM API with points and labels
    if (_points.length > 0) {
      _callInteractiveSegmentation(_points, _pointLabels).then((newMask) {
        if (newMask != null) {
          widget.onMaskUpdated(newMask);
        }
      });
    }
  }
}
