# Web Blank Screen Issue Fix

**Date**: June 18, 2025  
**Issue**: Flutter web app showing blank screen despite successful build  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  

## Problem Description

The Flutter web application was displaying a blank screen when running on Chrome, even though:
- `flutter build web` completed successfully
- HTML was being served correctly
- `flutter.js` was loading
- No compilation errors were reported

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified in the `UserConsentService` class where `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` was failing silently on the web platform, causing the `_checkInitialConditions()` method in `main.dart` to hang indefinitely. This prevented the Flutter app from initializing properly.

**Specific failure points:**
1. `UserConsentService.hasAllRequiredConsents()` - Called during app initialization
2. `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` - Not properly handling web platform failures
3. `FutureBuilder` in main.dart - Never completing due to hanging async operation
4. Result: Blank screen with no Flutter content rendered

### Technical Details

**Symptoms observed:**
- `main.dart.js` returning 404 in development mode
- No Flutter Inspector or Property Editor links
- Browser console showing Flutter.js loaded but no app initialization
- HTML serving correctly but Flutter content missing

**Investigation steps:**
1. Verified WasteAppLogger web compatibility (already fixed)
2. Created minimal test app - confirmed basic Flutter web works
3. Identified UserConsentService as failure point
4. Added error handling for SharedPreferences operations

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

**File**: `lib/services/user_consent_service.dart`

Added comprehensive error handling to all SharedPreferences operations:

**File**: `lib/main.dart`

Added timeout protection to prevent indefinite hanging:

```dart
Future<Map<String, bool>> _checkInitialConditions() async {
  // Wait a bit to show splash screen
  await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1));

  try {
    // Check user consent status with timeout for web compatibility
    final userConsentService = UserConsentService();
    final hasConsent = await userConsentService.hasAllRequiredConsents()
        .timeout(const Duration(seconds: 3));
    
    return {
      'hasConsent': hasConsent,
    };
  } catch (e) {
    // If consent check fails (e.g., on web), assume no consent
    // This allows the app to continue and show the consent dialog
    return {
      'hasConsent': false,
    };
  }
}
```

```dart
// Check if user has consented to privacy policy
Future<bool> hasPrivacyPolicyConsent() async {
  try {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    return prefs.getBool(_privacyPolicyConsentKey) ?? false;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}

// Check if user has consented to terms of service
Future<bool> hasTermsOfServiceConsent() async {
  try {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    return prefs.getBool(_termsOfServiceConsentKey) ?? false;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}

// Check if user needs to re-consent due to version changes
Future<bool> needsReconsent() async {
  try {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    final savedPrivacyVersion = prefs.getString(_privacyPolicyVersionKey) ?? '';
    final savedTermsVersion = prefs.getString(_termsOfServiceVersionKey) ?? '';
    
    return (savedPrivacyVersion != currentPrivacyPolicyVersion) || 
           (savedTermsVersion != currentTermsOfServiceVersion);
  } catch (e) {
    // If we can't check versions, assume reconsent is needed
    return true;
  }
}

// Check if user has given all required consents
Future<bool> hasAllRequiredConsents() async {
  try {
    final hasPrivacy = await hasPrivacyPolicyConsent();
    final hasTerms = await hasTermsOfServiceConsent();
    final needsNew = await needsReconsent();
    
    return hasPrivacy && hasTerms && !needsNew;
  } catch (e) {
    // On web or if SharedPreferences fails, assume no consent
    // This allows the app to continue and show the consent dialog
    return false;
  }
}
```

### Why This Fix Works

1. **Graceful Degradation**: If SharedPreferences fails on web, the app assumes no consent and shows the consent dialog
2. **Non-blocking**: Prevents the initialization from hanging indefinitely
3. **Platform Agnostic**: Works on all platforms while being web-compatible
4. **User Experience**: Maintains expected flow by showing consent dialog when needed

## Verification

### Build Verification
```bash
flutter build web --dart-define-from-file=.env
# ✅ Compiled successfully: 68,881,880 input bytes to 5,592,041 characters JavaScript
# ✅ No compilation errors
# ✅ Built build/web
```

### Runtime Verification
```bash
# Production build test
cd build/web && python3 -m http.server 8084
curl -s -I http://localhost:8084/main.dart.js
# ✅ HTTP/1.0 200 OK

# Development mode test
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define-from-file=.env
# ✅ App loads and displays content
# ✅ Consent dialog appears as expected
# ✅ No blank screen
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Blank screen on web
- ❌ `main.dart.js` not loading (404)
- ❌ App initialization hanging
- ❌ No Flutter Inspector/Property Editor

### After Fix
- ✅ App loads correctly on web
- ✅ Consent dialog displays properly
- ✅ Full Flutter functionality available
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

## Related Issues

This fix resolves the web compatibility issue while maintaining the existing WasteAppLogger web fixes implemented previously. The solution ensures that:

1. **WasteAppLogger**: Already web-compatible (previous fix)
2. **UserConsentService**: Now web-compatible (this fix)
3. **App Initialization**: Robust error handling throughout
4. **User Experience**: Consistent across all platforms

## Future Considerations

1. **SharedPreferences Web**: Monitor for any other SharedPreferences usage that might need similar error handling
2. **Platform Detection**: Consider adding explicit web platform checks where needed
3. **Error Reporting**: Add proper error logging for SharedPreferences failures
4. **Testing**: Include web-specific integration tests for critical paths

## Deployment Notes

- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Migration Required**: None
- **Environment Variables**: No changes required
- **Dependencies**: No updates needed

This fix ensures the Waste Segregation App works correctly on web browsers while maintaining full functionality on mobile and desktop platforms.
