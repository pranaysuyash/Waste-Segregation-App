# Fresh Start and Data Archival System

**Date:** June 17, 2025  
**Status:** Implemented and Ready  
**Purpose:** Provide safe data archival and fresh start capabilities for the Waste Segregation App

## Overview

This system provides two complementary approaches to achieve a fresh start experience while preserving valuable test data:

1. **Full Firebase Archival** - Archives all Firebase data to timestamped collections and clears main collections
2. **Local Fresh Start** - Clears only local storage while keeping Firebase data intact

Both approaches include automatic sync prevention to ensure the fresh start experience isn't compromised by unwanted data restoration.

## Problem Statement

During development and testing, the app accumulates significant amounts of test data including:
- User classifications and history
- Gamification data (points, achievements, streaks)
- Community feed entries
- Leaderboard entries
- Analytics events

The existing delete functionality was incomplete, leaving residual data that would sync back from Firebase, preventing a truly clean start experience.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Firebase Archival Service (`scripts/archive_and_fresh_start.dart`)

**Purpose:** Complete Firebase data archival with restore capability

**Features:**
- Archives all collections to timestamped backup collections
- Preserves user subcollections (classifications, etc.)
- Creates detailed archive metadata for tracking
- Provides full restore capability
- Clears both Firebase and local storage
- Batch processing for large datasets

**Collections Archived:**
```
users → archive_2025_06_17_15_54_users
community_feed → archive_2025_06_17_15_54_community_feed
leaderboard_allTime → archive_2025_06_17_15_54_leaderboard_allTime
admin_classifications → archive_2025_06_17_15_54_admin_classifications
// ... and 15+ other collections
```

### 2. Local Fresh Start Service (`scripts/local_fresh_start.dart`)

**Purpose:** Quick local cleanup without touching Firebase

**Features:**
- Clears all local Hive storage boxes
- Clears SharedPreferences (except fresh start settings)
- Enables fresh start mode
- Shows storage status before/after
- Preserves Firebase data for potential future access

### 3. Fresh Start Service (`lib/services/fresh_start_service.dart`)

**Purpose:** Manages fresh start mode and prevents unwanted sync

**Features:**
- Tracks fresh start mode state
- Prevents automatic sync for 24 hours after fresh start
- Stores archive metadata for restoration
- Provides status monitoring

### 4. Cloud Storage Service Integration

**Purpose:** Respects fresh start mode during sync operations

**Changes:**
- Added fresh start mode checks to all sync methods
- Prevents cloud-to-local sync during fresh start period
- Prevents local-to-cloud sync during fresh start period
- Logs sync prevention for debugging

## Usage Instructions

### Option 1: Full Firebase Archival (Recommended for Production)

```bash
# Show help and options
dart run scripts/archive_and_fresh_start.dart --help

# Archive data safely without clearing (test mode)
dart run scripts/archive_and_fresh_start.dart --archive-only

# Full archive and fresh start (destructive)
dart run scripts/archive_and_fresh_start.dart

# List available archives
dart run scripts/archive_and_fresh_start.dart --list-archives

# Restore from specific archive
dart run scripts/archive_and_fresh_start.dart --restore 2025_06_17_15_54
```

**Process:**
1. Creates timestamped archive collections in Firebase
2. Copies all data with archive metadata
3. Clears main collections completely
4. Clears local Hive storage
5. Enables fresh start mode
6. Provides restore instructions

### Option 2: Local Fresh Start (Quick Development Reset)

```bash
# Show help and options
dart run scripts/local_fresh_start.dart --help

# Check current storage status
dart run scripts/local_fresh_start.dart --status

# Perform local fresh start
dart run scripts/local_fresh_start.dart

# Skip confirmation prompt
dart run scripts/local_fresh_start.dart --no-confirm
```

**Process:**
1. Clears all local Hive storage boxes
2. Clears SharedPreferences (preserving fresh start settings)
3. Enables fresh start mode
4. Leaves Firebase data untouched

## Fresh Start Mode Behavior

When fresh start mode is enabled:

1. **Auto-sync Prevention:** All automatic sync operations are blocked for 24 hours
2. **Manual Sync Allowed:** Users can still manually trigger sync if needed
3. **Logging:** All prevented sync operations are logged for debugging
4. **Status Tracking:** Fresh start status is tracked and can be queried

### Fresh Start Mode Methods

```dart
// Check if in fresh start mode
bool isFreshStart = await FreshStartService.isFreshStartMode();

// Enable fresh start mode
await FreshStartService.enableFreshStartMode(archiveTimestamp: '2025_06_17_15_54');

// Disable fresh start mode
await FreshStartService.disableFreshStartMode();

// Check if sync should be prevented
bool shouldPrevent = await FreshStartService.shouldPreventAutoSync();

// Get full status info
Map<String, dynamic> info = await FreshStartService.getFreshStartInfo();
```

## Archive Structure

### Archive Collections Format

Each archive creates collections with the naming pattern:
```
archive_{TIMESTAMP}_{COLLECTION_NAME}
```

Example:
```
archive_2025_06_17_15_54_users
archive_2025_06_17_15_54_community_feed
archive_2025_06_17_15_54_leaderboard_allTime
```

### Archive Metadata

Each archive creates a metadata document in `archive_metadata` collection:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025_06_17_15_54",
  "created_at": "2025-06-17T15:54:00Z",
  "total_documents": 1247,
  "total_collections": 18,
  "archived_collections": ["users", "community_feed", ...],
  "description": "Full data archive created for fresh start",
  "can_restore": true,
  "restore_instructions": "Use restore command with this timestamp"
}
```

### Document Archive Format

Each archived document includes original data plus metadata:

```json
{
  // ... original document data ...
  "_archived_at": "2025-06-17T15:54:00Z",
  "_original_collection": "users",
  "_original_doc_id": "user123",
  "_archive_timestamp": "2025_06_17_15_54"
}
```

## Safety Features
