☑️ Require signed commits (optional but recommended)

Required Status Checks (Add These):
✅ build (existing)
✅ test (existing)  
✅ golden_tests (existing)
✅ code_quality (existing)
🆕 trivy-scan (new security scanning)
🆕 dependency-scan (new dependency analysis)
🆕 secrets-scan (new secrets detection)
🆕 performance-analysis (new performance monitoring)
```

### **Priority 3: Create First Automated Release** 🎉
```bash
# 1. Update version in pubspec.yaml (e.g., to 2.2.5)
# 2. Add comprehensive entry to CHANGELOG.md
# 3. Commit version changes
git add pubspec.yaml CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: bump version to v2.2.5 with enhanced DevOps infrastructure"
git push origin main

# 4. Create and push tag to trigger automated release
git tag v2.2.5
git push origin v2.2.5

# 5. Watch the magic happen:
# ✅ Automated multi-platform builds
# ✅ Professional release notes with changelog
