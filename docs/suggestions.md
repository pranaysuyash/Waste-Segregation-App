# Suggestions and Issue Documentation

Use separate markdown files to document suggestions and issues:
- `suggestions.md` for proposed improvements and ideas.
- `issues.md` for identified problems or bugs.

Feel free to add entries as needed, and use your discretion to organize and update these files for clarity and usefulness.
