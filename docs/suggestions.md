# Suggestions for Implementation

This document contains detailed suggestions for features that could be implemented to enhance the application.

## High-Priority Features

### 1. AI Accuracy Feedback Loop (In Progress)

**Description:**
Implement a user feedback mechanism on the classification results screen that allows users to confirm or correct AI classifications. This will build user trust and provide valuable data for improving the AI model over time.

**Implementation Details:**
1. Add a "Was this classification correct?" UI element to the results screen
   - Simple Yes/No buttons prominently displayed
   - Positioned below the classification results but above other details

2. When user selects "No":
   - Display a dropdown or cascading selection for correct category/subcategory
   - Use the same category hierarchy as the AI classification
   - Include a small text field for optional user comments

3. Logging and analytics:
   - Store correction data with original and user-corrected classifications
   - Include image hash (but not the actual image) for reference
   - Log timestamp, confidence scores, and any user comments

4. Future model improvement:
   - Implement analytics dashboard for reviewing corrections
   - Create data export functionality for model retraining
   - Consider implementing periodic model updates based on collected data

**User Experience Benefits:**
- Provides a sense of agency and contribution
- Increases trust by acknowledging AI limitations
- Turns frustration (incorrect classifications) into constructive engagement
- Creates a positive feedback loop that improves the app over time

**Technical Considerations:**
- Initially store feedback data locally, with synchronization to backend if user is signed in
- Ensure privacy by not storing actual images, only hashes and classification data
- Consider batch processing of feedback data to reduce API loads

- `lib/screens/result_screen.dart` (Main UI implementation)
- `lib/services/ai_service.dart` (Integration with AI system)
- `lib/services/storage_service.dart` (Feedback data storage)
