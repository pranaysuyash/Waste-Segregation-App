```dart
// Pseudocode
class LocalizationManager {
  // Current app language
  Locale currentLocale;
  
  // Available languages map
  Map<String, String> availableLanguages;
  
  // Load localized strings
  Future<Map<String, String>> loadLocalizedStrings(Locale locale);
  
  // Get localized string
  String getString(String key, {Map<String, String>? parameters});
  
  // Change app language
  Future<void> changeLanguage(Locale newLocale);
  
  // Detect user preferred language
  Future<Locale> detectPreferredLanguage();
  
  // Get language-specific waste categories
  Map<String, WasteCategory> getLocalizedWasteCategories();
}
```

#### 2.2.2 Voice Recognition System

```dart
// Pseudocode
class VoiceRecognitionService {
  // Current language for recognition
  Locale recognitionLocale;
  
  // Start listening for speech
  Future<void> startListening({
    Duration? maxDuration,
    bool partialResults = true,
    Function(String)? onPartialResult,
    Function(String)? onFinalResult,
    Function(Exception)? onError,
  });
  
  // Stop listening
  Future<String?> stopListening();
  
  // Check if speech recognition is available
  Future<bool> isAvailable();
  
  // Get supported recognition languages
  Future<List<Locale>> getSupportedLanguages();
}
```

#### 2.2.3 Text-to-Speech System

```dart
// Pseudocode
class TextToSpeechService {
  // Current language for speech
  Locale speechLocale;
  
  // Speak text
  Future<void> speak(String text, {
    double rate = 1.0,
    double pitch = 1.0,
    double volume = 1.0,
    Function? onComplete,
  });
  
  // Stop speaking
  Future<void> stop();
  
  // Check if speaking is in progress
  bool get isSpeaking;
  
  // Get available voices for current locale
  Future<List<Voice>> getAvailableVoices();
  
  // Set preferred voice
  Future<void> setVoice(Voice voice);
}
```

#### 2.2.4 Waste Term Recognition System

```dart
// Pseudocode
class WasteTermRecognizer {
  // Recognize waste category from natural language input
  Future<List<RecognizedWasteItem>> recognizeWasteTerm(
    String input,
    Locale locale,
  );
  
  // Get waste category suggestions based on partial input
  Future<List<WasteCategorySuggestion>> getSuggestions(
    String partialInput,
    Locale locale,
  );
  
  // Load regional synonym database
  Future<void> loadRegionalSynonyms(Locale locale);
  
  // Add user-contributed synonym
  Future<void> addUserSynonym(
    String term,
    String standardTerm,
    Locale locale,
  );
}
```
