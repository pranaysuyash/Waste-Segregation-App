# User Management Enhancement Discussion Summary

## Current State Assessment

After reviewing the existing codebase, we identified the following about the current user management system:

1. **Basic Authentication**: The app currently supports Google Sign-In and guest mode, but lacks comprehensive user profile management.

2. **No Multi-User Support**: There is no existing functionality for family members, teams, or households to share and collaborate within the app.

3. **Limited User Data**: The current user model only stores basic information (userId, email, displayName) without additional profile details.

4. **Individual-Focused Analytics**: The dashboard and gamification systems are designed for individual users rather than groups or families.

## Discussion Outcomes

1. **Prioritization of User Management**: Before implementing other enhancements (like advanced gamification or dashboard features), we agreed to focus on building out the user management system as a foundation for collaborative features.

2. **Family/Team Model**: We determined that a family/team model would be the most appropriate approach for enabling multi-user collaboration, with:
   - Primary account holders who can manage family settings
   - Different roles for family members
   - Shared data and analytics

3. **Invitation System**: We identified the need for a robust invitation system to facilitate adding family members, with support for:
   - Email-based invitations
   - Link sharing
   - QR code generation for in-person onboarding

4. **Data Sharing Model**: We discussed the importance of implementing a proper data sharing model that:
   - Maintains individual privacy when needed
   - Enables aggregated family statistics
   - Supports collaborative challenges and goals

## Next Steps

1. **Detailed Technical Specification**:
   - Create a detailed technical specification for the user management system
   - Define database schema changes and additions
   - Specify API endpoints and service modifications

2. **UI/UX Design**:
   - Design wireframes for family management screens
   - Create flow diagrams for invitation and onboarding processes
   - Design the family dashboard and user switching interfaces

3. **Implementation Planning**:
   - Break down implementation tasks into sprints
   - Prioritize critical path features
   - Identify dependency chains in the implementation

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Define test cases for multi-user scenarios
   - Plan for security and privacy testing
   - Develop acceptance criteria for family features

## Timeline

1. **Technical Specification & Design**: 1-2 weeks
2. **Core User Profile Enhancements**: 2-3 weeks
3. **Family/Team Foundation**: 3-4 weeks
4. **Multi-User Features**: 2-3 weeks
5. **Polish and Integration**: 2 weeks

Total estimated timeline: 10-14 weeks

## Open Questions

1. **Data Migration**: How should we handle migration of existing user data into the new family model?

2. **Backend Requirements**: Do we need to implement a backend service (like Firebase) to better support real-time multi-user features?

3. **Authentication Expansion**: Should we expand authentication options beyond Google Sign-In as part of this enhancement?

4. **Family Size Limitations**: Should we implement limits on family/team size, particularly for the free tier of the app?

5. **Privacy Controls**: What granularity of privacy controls should be implemented for shared family data?

These questions will need to be addressed in the technical specification phase before implementation begins.
