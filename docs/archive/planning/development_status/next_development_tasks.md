# Next Development Tasks for Waste Segregation App v0.9.1

This document outlines the specific development tasks to be addressed in the next version update (v0.9.1) based on the review of current codebase and issues identified in the Google Play Store submission.

## Critical UI Fixes

### 1. Result Screen Text Overflow Issues
- **File:** `/lib/screens/result_screen.dart`
- **Issues:**
  - Material type information in the "Material Information" section can overflow
  - Educational facts can be too lengthy for the container
  - Long descriptions don't handle overflow properly
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement `TextOverflow.ellipsis` with appropriate `maxLines` properties
  - Add "Read More" buttons for lengthy content sections
  - Ensure proper padding and margins for text containers
  - Test with extra-long text to verify fixes

### 2. Recycling Code Info Widget Improvement
- **File:** `/lib/widgets/recycling_code_info.dart`
- **Issues:**
  - Inconsistent display of recycling codes with fixed vs. dynamic content
  - Directly accessing `WasteInfo.recyclingCodes[code]` without proper handling
  - No structure for displaying plastic name vs. examples
- **Tasks:**
  - Refactor widget to separate plastic name and examples
  - Implement proper null handling and length checking
  - Add "Read More" functionality for long descriptions
  - Create a structured display with consistent formatting
  - Test with all recycling codes (1-7)

## Settings Screen Completion

### 1. Offline Mode Settings Implementation
- **File:** `/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`
- **Current Status:** UI present but functionality incomplete (TODO in code)
- **Tasks:**
  - Create an `OfflineModeSettingsScreen` or dialog
  - Implement toggles for enabling/disabling offline classification
  - Add storage space information for offline models
  - Create preferences storage for offline mode settings
  - Connect UI controls to actual functionality

### 2. Data Export Functionality
- **File:** `/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` and potentially new service
- **Current Status:** Premium feature UI present but functionality incomplete
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement CSV export option for classification history
  - Implement JSON export option for complete user data
  - Create proper file saving mechanism (compatible with all platforms)
  - Add export progress indicator
  - Test export functionality with large datasets

### 3. Theme Settings Enhancement
- **File:** `/lib/screens/theme_settings_screen.dart`
- **Tasks:**
  - Complete theme customization options
  - Ensure proper theme persistence across app restarts
  - Add preview functionality for theme changes
  - Implement dark mode optimizations

## Gamification Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Feedback Connection
- **File:** `/lib/screens/result_screen.dart`
- **Issues:** Need stronger connection between user actions and visible point/achievement updates
- **Tasks:**
  - Make points earned more visible on result screen
  - Improve animation timing for point notifications
  - Add immediate notification for challenge progress
  - Show achievement progress updates with clear visual cues
  - Implement "tap for details" functionality on notifications

> Bug Fix: The issue where points/animations would show when viewing history is now fixed. `ResultScreen` now only shows points for new classifications.

### 2. Challenge Progress Visualization
- **File:** Potentially new widget and changes to existing gamification widgets
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a clearer challenge progress bar
  - Add visual indicators when a classification contributes to challenge progress
  - Implement celebratory animations for significant progress increments
  - Connect progress visualization to result screen

## AI Accuracy and Feedback

### 1. AI Classification Consistency
- **File:** `/lib/services/ai_service.dart`
- **Issues:** Multiple attempts to classify complex scenes produce different results
- **Tasks:**
  - Improve pre-processing for more consistent results
  - Implement confidence score display
  - Add mechanisms to refine classification results
  - Create "object selection" mode for complex scenes with multiple items

### 2. AI Accuracy Feedback Loop
- **File:** New functionality across multiple files
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement "Was this classification correct?" UI on result screen
  - Create feedback storage mechanism
  - Add correction functionality for users
  - Implement analytics for tracking feedback trends
  - Design data pipeline for model improvements

## Image Segmentation Enhancement

### 1. Complete SAM Implementation
- **File:** Multiple files related to image processing
- **Current Status:** UI placeholders exist but functionality incomplete
- **Tasks:**
  - Complete Facebook's SAM integration for object detection
  - Implement multi-object detection in images
  - Connect segmentation UI to functional backend
  - Test segmentation with complex scenes
  - Add user controls for refining segmentation

### 2. Interactive Object Selection
- **File:** New or existing image processing screens
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement touch interface for selecting objects in complex scenes
  - Create visual indicators for selected regions
  - Allow users to confirm or refine automatic selections
  - Test with different device sizes and screen resolutions

## Technical Debt & Code Quality

### 1. UI Refactoring
- **Files:** Multiple screen and widget files
- **Tasks:**
  - Extract common UI elements into reusable widgets
  - Break down large build methods into smaller methods
  - Improve code organization with consistent patterns
  - Add comprehensive documentation

### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Files:** Across the codebase
- **Tasks:**
  - Identify and fix memory leaks
  - Optimize image processing pipeline
  - Improve loading times for results screen
  - Reduce unnecessary rebuilds
  - Test performance on lower-end devices

## Testing Plan

### 1. UI Testing
- Create UI tests for critical screens
- Test overflow scenarios with long text
- Verify fixes for identified UI issues
- Test responsive layouts across different device sizes

### 2. Functional Testing
- Test AI classification with complex scenes
- Verify gamification feedback flow
- Test settings functionality
- Validate export functionality

### 3. Performance Testing
- Measure and compare startup time
- Monitor memory usage
- Test image processing performance

## Documentation Updates

### 1. Code Documentation
- Add comments to clarify complex logic
- Document newly implemented features
- Update any existing incorrect documentation

### 2. User Documentation
- Update user guide with new features
- Create how-to guides for new functionality
- Document known limitations

## Implementation Priority

Based on critical nature and user impact, the suggested implementation order is:

1. Result Screen Text Overflow Fixes (high impact on user experience)
2. Recycling Code Info Widget Improvement (visible issue in demo)
3. Gamification Feedback Enhancement (addresses direct user feedback)
4. Settings Screen Completion (completes partially implemented features)
5. AI Classification Consistency (improves core functionality)
6. Image Segmentation (adds advanced capability)

## Version Update Information

- **Current Version:** 0.9.1+91
- **Target Version:** 0.9.2+92
- **Focus:** UI Polishing and Core Feature Completion
- **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 development weeks

This task list should be updated as work progresses, with completed items marked and any new issues discovered during implementation added to the appropriate sections.
