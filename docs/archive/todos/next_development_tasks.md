# Next Development Tasks for Waste Segregation App v0.9.1

This document outlines the specific development tasks to be addressed in the next version update (v0.9.1) based on the review of current codebase and issues identified in the Google Play Store submission.

## Critical UI Fixes

### 1. Result Screen Text Overflow Issues
- **File:** `/lib/screens/result_screen.dart`
- **Issues:**
  - Material type information in the "Material Information" section can overflow
  - Educational facts can be too lengthy for the container
  - Long descriptions don't handle overflow properly
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement `TextOverflow.ellipsis` with appropriate `maxLines` properties
  - Add "Read More" buttons for lengthy content sections
  - Ensure proper padding and margins for text containers
  - Test with extra-long text to verify fixes

### 2. Recycling Code Info Widget Improvement
- **File:** `/lib/widgets/recycling_code_info.dart`
- **Issues:**
  - Inconsistent display of recycling codes with fixed vs. dynamic content
  - Directly accessing `WasteInfo.recyclingCodes[code]` without proper handling
  - No structure for displaying plastic name vs. examples
- **Tasks:**
  - Refactor widget to separate plastic name and examples
  - Implement proper null handling and length checking
  - Add "Read More" functionality for long descriptions
  - Create a structured display with consistent formatting
  - Test with all recycling codes (1-7)

**Update (v0.9.2):** ✅ COMPLETED - Widget completely refactored with RecyclingCode model, sub-widgets, animations, and enhanced UX.

**Detailed Completion Summary:**
- **Data Modeling:** Replaced raw data maps with strongly-typed `RecyclingCode` model (`/lib/models/recycling_code.dart`)
- **Componentization:** Extracted reusable sub-widgets (`CodeCircle`, `InfoRow`)
- **Animations:** Added smooth expand/collapse animations, rotating chevron, haptic feedback
- **Interactivity:** Implemented long-press-to-copy for examples
- **UI/UX:** Theme-aware colors, typography hierarchy, color-coded status borders, Card elevation
- **Code Quality:** Removed deprecated APIs, added custom `Color` extension (`/lib/utils/color_extensions.dart`)
- **Accessibility:** Added semantic labels for screen readers
- **i18n Ready:** Marked all strings with `TODO(i18n)` comments for future localization

## Settings Screen Completion

### 1. Offline Mode Settings Implementation
- **File:** `/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`
- **Current Status:** UI present but functionality incomplete (TODO in code)
- **Tasks:**
  - Create an `OfflineModeSettingsScreen` or dialog
  - Implement toggles for enabling/disabling offline classification
  - Add storage space information for offline models
  - Create preferences storage for offline mode settings
  - Connect UI controls to actual functionality

### 2. Data Export Functionality
- **File:** `/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` and potentially new service
- **Current Status:** Premium feature UI present but functionality incomplete
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement CSV export option for classification history
  - Implement JSON export option for complete user data
  - Create proper file saving mechanism (compatible with all platforms)
  - Add export progress indicator
  - Test export functionality with large datasets

### 3. Theme Settings Enhancement

- **Issue:** Multiple competing point management systems causing inconsistent displays across screens
- **Solution:** Implemented centralized Points Engine as single source of truth
- **Completion Summary:**
  - **Centralized Architecture**: Created atomic Points Engine with operation locks and conflict resolution
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy GamificationService now delegates to Points Engine
  - **Provider Integration**: Added PointsEngineProvider to main app provider tree
  - **Migration Utilities**: Built migration system for existing user data
  - **Consistency Achieved**: All screens now show identical point totals
  - **Performance Improved**: Eliminated race conditions and cache inconsistencies

### 2. Enhanced Feedback Connection
- **File:** `/lib/screens/result_screen.dart`

- **Tasks:**
  - Make points earned more visible on result screen
  - Improve animation timing for point notifications
  - Add immediate notification for challenge progress
  - Show achievement progress updates with clear visual cues
  - Implement "tap for details" functionality on notifications

> Bug Fix: The issue where points/animations would show when viewing history is now fixed. `ResultScreen` now only shows points for new classifications.

### 2. Challenge Progress Visualization
- **File:** Potentially new widget and changes to existing gamification widgets
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a clearer challenge progress bar
  - Add visual indicators when a classification contributes to challenge progress
  - Implement celebratory animations for significant progress increments
  - Connect progress visualization to result screen
