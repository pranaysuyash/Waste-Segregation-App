## Documentation Maintenance Guidelines

### Deprecated Documents

Documents marked as **DEPRECATED** have been consolidated into more comprehensive documents and should not be updated. They contain redirects to the current sources of truth.

### Document Consolidation Strategy

To reduce documentation fragmentation and improve maintainability, we've implemented a consolidation strategy:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each major component or feature should have one authoritative document
2. **Redirects from Legacy Documents**: Old documents contain redirects to their replacements
3. **Unified Architecture**: The comprehensive architecture document provides a complete system overview

### Updating Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. Check if the document is marked as deprecated before making changes
2. For architecture changes, update the comprehensive architecture document
3. For feature status updates, modify the `project_features.md` document located in `docs/planning/roadmap/`
4. For user flows, update the appropriate current or future user flows document
