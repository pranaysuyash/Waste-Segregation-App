## Documentation Notes

### Document Overlap and Consolidation
Several documents have overlapping content due to the merging of the main docs folder and the enhancements folder. The following documents have significant overlap and may be candidates for future consolidation:

1. **Gamification Documentation**:
   - `enhanced_gamification_spec.md` and `advanced_gamification_system.md` cover similar topics with different levels of detail.
   - Recommendation: Keep both for now, but consider merging into a comprehensive gamification document in the future.

2. **AI Strategy Documents**:
   - `ai_strategy_multimodel.md` and `multi_model_ai_strategy.md` have overlapping content.
   - Recommendation: Consider consolidating these into a single AI strategy document.

3. **App Store Launch Documents**:
   - `app_store_launch_playbook.md` and `app_store_launch_strategy.md` cover related content.
   - Recommendation: Consider merging these into a single app store launch guide.

4. **Industry Trends Documents**:
   - `industry_trends_2025.md` and `industry_trends_and_competitive_positioning.md` have related content.
   - Recommendation: Consider merging these into a comprehensive industry analysis document.

5. **Enhancement Documentation**:
   - Several documents from the former enhancements folder represent "Part 2" or extensions of concepts in the main docs.
   - Recommendation: Consider creating consolidated versions that incorporate both parts of related documents.

### Documentation Maintenance Guidelines

1. **File Naming Convention**:
   - Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores for spaces
   - Append version numbers or dates only when maintaining multiple versions is necessary

2. **Document Structure**:
   - Each document should begin with a clear title and brief overview
   - Use consistent heading levels (# for title, ## for main sections, etc.)
   - Include links to related documents where appropriate

3. **Updates and Versioning**:
   - When updating documents, add a "Last Updated" date at the top
   - For significant revisions, consider adding a change log at the end of the document
   - Avoid creating multiple versions of the same document; update in place when possible

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Place it in the appropriate directory based on the content category
2. Add a link to the new document in this README index
3. Follow the established formatting and naming conventions
4. Consider whether the new document should replace or extend existing documentation

# Premium Features and Ad Implementation

## Notes for Developers
- The `PremiumService` manages the state of premium features using Hive for persistent storage
- A test mode is available in the settings screen (only in debug mode) to toggle premium features
- Ad display follows rules defined in `AdService` - classifications, educational content, and settings screens do not show ads
- Interstitial ads are shown after every 5 classifications, with a minimum 5-minute interval between displays
