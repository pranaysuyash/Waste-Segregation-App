# Google Play Store Post-Approval Plan

This document outlines the recommended next steps once the Waste Segregation App is approved by the Google Play Store. It focuses on ensuring a smooth launch, gathering initial user feedback, and preparing for future updates.

## Immediate Post-Approval Actions

### 1. Internal Testing Phase (1-2 weeks)

- **Deploy to Internal Testing Track**:
  - Make the app available to a limited group of internal testers (5-10 people)
  - Verify APK installation on various Android device configurations
  - Test core functionality in the production environment
  - Check that API keys and cloud services function correctly
  - Verify proper initialization of Google AdMob (if implemented)
  - Ensure Google Analytics is correctly gathering data

- **Store Listing Verification**:
  - Check that all screenshots render correctly on the Play Store
  - Verify that app description formatting is maintained
  - Confirm that the privacy policy link works correctly
  - Test app install process from different devices

- **Performance Monitoring Setup**:
  - Ensure crash reporting is functional in the production environment
  - Set up alerts for critical issues
  - Configure performance monitoring thresholds
  - Test the error reporting communication channel

### 2. Staged Rollout to Production (2-4 weeks)

- **Initial 10% Rollout**:
  - Begin with a very limited production rollout (10% of users)
  - Monitor crash reports and ANRs (Application Not Responding) closely
  - Track installation success rates
  - Watch for unexpected permission issues
  - Monitor initial user retention metrics

- **Expand to 25% After Stability Confirmation**:
  - If no critical issues are found after 3-5 days, expand to 25%
  - Continue monitoring performance metrics
  - Begin analyzing user behavior data
  - Watch for any edge case issues that might appear with the larger audience

- **Gradually Increase to 100%**:
  - Expand to 50% after 3-5 more days of stability
  - Finally release to 100% after confirming stability at 50%
  - Maintain heightened monitoring throughout the rollout process

### 3. Initial User Feedback Collection

- **Implement Feedback Channels**:
  - Monitor Play Store reviews carefully
  - Respond to initial user feedback promptly
  - Categorize feedback for future improvements
