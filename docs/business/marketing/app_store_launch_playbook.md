   - Analyze competitor apps for keyword insights
   - Consider user intent and search behavior
   - Focus on waste management, recycling, and sustainability terms

2. **Primary Keyword List for iOS**:
   - waste sorting
   - recycling app
   - waste classification
   - waste segregation
   - sustainability app
   - proper disposal
   - eco friendly
   - green living
   - trash sorting
   - waste management

3. **Long-tail Keyword Opportunities**:
   - how to recycle properly
   - what bin does it go in
   - waste sorting helper
   - AI recycling assistant
   - recycling identification
   - learn to recycle
   - reduce landfill waste
   - environmental impact app

4. **Google Play Keyword Strategy**:
   - Focus on natural language in descriptions
   - Incorporate keywords naturally in first 167 characters
   - Use related terms throughout description
   - Include keywords in title and short description

### Title and Subtitle Optimization

**App Name Formulation**:
- Primary: "Waste Segregation - AI Sorting App"
- Alternative: "EcoSort: Waste Classification AI"

**iOS Subtitle** (30 characters):
"Scan & identify proper disposal"

**Google Play Short Description** (80 characters):
"AI-powered app that instantly identifies where your waste should go"

### Description Optimization

**First Paragraph Strategy**:
- Include primary keywords in first sentence
- Address main user pain point (confusion about waste sorting)
- Highlight unique value proposition
- Keep to 2-3 sentences for readability

**Feature Bulletpoints Strategy**:
- Start each bullet with an action verb
- Incorporate secondary keywords
- Focus on user benefits rather than technical features
- Include social proof elements where possible

**Call to Action Strategy**:
- Create urgency with environmental impact framing
- Use action-oriented language
- Highlight free download or premium value
- End with environmental mission statement

### Metadata Implementation

For iOS, distribute keywords strategically across:
- App name
- Subtitle
- Keyword field (comma-separated, no spaces)
- In-app purchase descriptions

For Google Play, distribute keywords across:
- App title
- Short description
- Full description (repeated naturally 3-5 times)
- Developer name (if appropriate)

### Visual Asset Optimization

**Screenshot Design Strategy**:
- Use first screenshot to show core classification feature
- Include captions explaining key benefits
- Follow consistent visual language
- Show actual app screens with minimal mockup framing
- Demonstrate progression through user journey

**App Icon Design Psychology**:
- Use recognizable waste segregation symbolism
- Ensure icon is distinguishable at small sizes
- Implement color psychology (greens for environment)
- Test multiple variants for visual impact
- Avoid detailed illustrations that blur at small sizes

**Preview Video Strategy** (if applicable):
- Show core classification flow in first 10 seconds
- Highlight UI simplicity and ease of use
- Demonstrate problem-solution scenario
- Keep under 30 seconds total length
- Include captions for accessibility
