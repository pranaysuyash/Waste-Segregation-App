## 👤 **GUEST USER DELETION/RECOVERY/ARCHIVAL FLOWS**

### **📱 Same Mobile Device**

#### **🗑️ Guest Data Deletion Flow**

**Current User Experience:**

```
Settings → Developer Options → Clear Firebase Data
├── User sees "Clear Data" confirmation
├── Loading indicator during process
├── All local data cleared
├── App returns to fresh install state
└── No user recovery options available
```

**🤖 Behind-the-Scenes ML Data Collection:**

```
Every Guest Classification (Invisible to User):
1. User saves classification locally
2. Anonymous ML data automatically collected:
   ├── Classification details (itemName, category, etc.)
   ├── Device identifier (anonymized)
   ├── Timestamp and region
   ├── No personal information
   └── Stored in admin_classifications for ML training

3. When user deletes local data:
   ├── Local Hive storage cleared
   ├── User loses access to their history
   ├── ML training data remains accessible to admin
   └── Anonymous data available for model training
```

**Enhanced Guest Deletion Flow:**

```
Settings → "Clear My Data"
├── Warning: "This will remove all your classifications and progress"
├── Option: "Export my data first" (CSV/JSON download)
├── Confirmation: "Are you sure? This cannot be undone"
├── Process: Clear all local storage
├── Result: Fresh app state
├── Information: "Create account to backup future data"
└── Behind scenes: ML training data preserved for admins
```

#### **🔄 Guest Data Reset Flow**

```
Guest Reset = Guest Deletion (same process)
├── All data is local to device
├── No separate reset concept for guests
├── No cloud data to preserve

├── Guest data is device-specific
├── No cross-device synchronization for users
└── Each device starts fresh

Admin/ML Perspective:
✅ All previous device data still accessible
├── Previous device classifications preserved
├── Anonymous data correlation possible
├── Multi-device usage pattern analysis
└── Historical ML training data maintained
```

#### **🔄 Guest Recovery on New Device**

```
