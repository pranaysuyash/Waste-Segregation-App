# Mobile UX/UI 2025 Best Practices - Task List

This document distills key actions for the Waste Segregation App based on the "Mobile UX/UI Analysis for Environmental Apps: 2025 Best Practices" research. The goal is to integrate modern usability, accessibility, and behavioral design patterns throughout the app.

## 1. Authentication & Onboarding

- Implement **biometric-first** authentication with PIN/password fallback.
- Provide **value-before-registration** onboarding with full guest mode.
- Introduce an **impact assessment entry point** (quick footprint or waste audit).
- Use GPS to establish **local relevance** (nearby facilities, schedules).
- Offer **sustainability goal setting** using self-determination theory.
- Ensure all touch targets are at least **24×24 CSS pixels** (preferably 48dp).
- Maintain **4.5:1 text contrast** and adapt to light/dark themes.
- Integrate **voice control** commands for onboarding actions.
- Limit initial flow to **three steps** with clear progress indicators.
- Use **skeleton screens** during any onboarding processing.

## 2. Core Functionality Screens

- Adopt a **single-action capture** pattern (tap photo, long-press video).
- Add shadows or gradient backgrounds for camera controls for **visual accessibility**.
- Display **AI confidence scores** and allow manual overrides.
- Optimize images using **WebP** and progressive loading.
- Handle heavy processing in the background with tight **memory management**.
- Show skeleton states and progress indicators while analyzing images.
- Deliver classification results within **3 seconds**, using color-coded status (green / amber / red).

- Visualize progress over time with accessible charts and voice summaries.

## 3. Gamification & Social Screens

- Introduce tiered achievements (Bronze/Silver/Gold) with public recognition.
- Show progress relative to similar users and highlight community impact.
- Support location-based challenges, team competitions, and privacy controls.
- Ensure leaderboards and social screens are fully keyboard navigable with alt text.

- Provide CSV, PDF, and JSON export with date range selection.
- Implement family/group management with role-based permissions and dashboards.
- Add a GIS‑powered facility finder with voice-guided navigation and offline maps.
- Visualize personal impact using concrete metrics (kg CO₂, liters saved).

## 6. Specialized Environmental Patterns

- Integrate real‑time disposal facility status updates with user reviews.
- Display location‑aware regulation summaries via icons and infographics.
- Facilitate community initiatives and real-time dashboards for local challenges.

## 7. Conversion & Behavioral Design
