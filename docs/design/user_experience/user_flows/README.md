## ðŸ›  Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Review the [Flow Diagram Templates](./flow_diagram_templates.md) before starting implementation
2. Check the [Prioritization Framework](./flow_prioritization_framework.md) for current priorities
3. Create detailed technical specifications based on flow documentation
4. Update flow diagrams when implementation differs from design

### For Designers
1. Use the [Comprehensive Catalog](./comprehensive_user_flows.md) as a reference for all flows
2. Create wireframes and mockups based on documented steps
3. Consider accessibility and error states in all flows
4. Validate designs against user research and usability testing

### For Product Managers
1. Reference the [Prioritization Framework](./flow_prioritization_framework.md) for roadmap planning
2. Use RICE scores to make data-driven prioritization decisions
3. Track implementation progress against defined success metrics
4. Regular review and update of flow priorities based on user feedback
