# User Flow Prioritization Framework
*Last Updated: December 2024*

This document provides a systematic approach to prioritize the comprehensive user flows catalog using the RICE framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) and strategic alignment criteria.

## RICE Scoring Framework

### Reach (1-10)
- **10**: Affects all users (100% user base)
- **8-9**: Affects majority of users (70-90%)
- **6-7**: Affects significant portion (40-70%)
- **4-5**: Affects moderate portion (20-40%)
- **1-3**: Affects small portion (<20%)

### Impact (1-10)
- **10**: Massive impact on key metrics (retention, engagement, revenue)
- **8-9**: High impact on primary metrics
- **6-7**: Moderate impact on multiple metrics
- **4-5**: Low-moderate impact on specific metrics
- **1-3**: Minimal measurable impact

### Confidence (1-10)
- **10**: Extremely confident (proven by data/research)
- **8-9**: High confidence (strong evidence)
- **6-7**: Medium confidence (some evidence)
- **4-5**: Low confidence (assumptions)
- **1-3**: Very low confidence (pure speculation)

### Effort (1-10, lower is better)
- **1-2**: Minimal effort (1-2 weeks)
- **3-4**: Low effort (1 month)
- **5-6**: Medium effort (2-3 months)
- **7-8**: High effort (3-6 months)
- **9-10**: Very high effort (6+ months)

## Priority Tiers
