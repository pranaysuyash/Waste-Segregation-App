# Color Contrast & Accessibility Improvements

## Summary
- All major screens have been reviewed and updated for color contrast and text visibility.
- Headers, body text, and buttons now use high-contrast colors appropriate for their backgrounds.
- Legal/consent dialogs, onboarding, and educational content are now fully readable in both light and dark themes.

## Approach
- Used `AppTheme.textPrimaryColor` for text on white/light backgrounds.
- Used `Colors.white` for text on colored backgrounds.
- Section headers and important text are bold and use high-contrast colors.
- All gray/low-contrast text replaced with darker, more readable colors.

## Result
- The app now meets WCAG AA standards for color contrast.
- Improved user experience for all users, including those with visual impairments.
