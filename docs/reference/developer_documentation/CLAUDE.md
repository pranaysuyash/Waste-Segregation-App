# Claude AI Integration and Usage Guide

This document outlines the integration of Claude AI (Anthropic) within the Waste Segregation App, specifically its role as a tertiary model in the multi-model AI strategy. It covers the rationale, API interaction, and considerations for its use.

## Role in Multi-Model AI Strategy

Claude AI serves as the **Tertiary Model** in our AI/ML pipeline. Its primary functions are:

1.  **Fallback Mechanism**: To be invoked if both the Primary (Gemini) and Secondary (OpenAI GPT-4V) models fail or return unsatisfactory results.
2.  **Specialized Analysis**: To be used for particularly complex or ambiguous items where its nuanced understanding and detailed reasoning might provide superior classification or explanation.
3.  **Comparative Benchmarking**: Its responses can be used periodically to benchmark against other models and identify areas where Claude might excel, potentially informing future adjustments to the model orchestration logic.

## Rationale for Choosing Claude

-   **Strong Analytical Reasoning**: Claude models are known for their strong reasoning capabilities, which can be beneficial for waste items that require understanding context or subtle visual cues.
-   **Different Model Architecture**: Provides diversity from Gemini and OpenAI, reducing the chance of all models failing on the same type of input due to shared architectural biases.
-   **Handling of Uncertainty**: Claude models can be good at expressing uncertainty or providing detailed explanations when a definitive classification is difficult, which is valuable for user education.
-   **Long Context Windows** (though less critical for single image classification): Useful if we expand to multi-image analysis or textual context accompanying images.

## API Interaction

Interaction with Claude will be via its official API. The `AiService` in the app will encapsulate the logic for calling Claude.

### Key API Parameters (Conceptual)

-   **Model**: Specify the Claude model version (e.g., `claude-3-opus-20240229`, `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`, `claude-3-haiku-20240307`). We'll likely start with Sonnet for a balance of capability and cost, or Haiku for speed if latency is critical in its tertiary role.
-   **Prompt**: A carefully crafted prompt will be sent, including:
    -   The image data (base64 encoded).
    -   System message defining Claude's role (e.g., "You are a waste classification expert. Analyze this image and classify the primary waste item.").
    -   Instructions on the desired output format (e.g., JSON with fields for `itemName`, `category`, `disposalMethod`, `reasoning`).
-   **Max Tokens**: To control the length and cost of the response.
-   **Temperature**: To control the creativity/determinism of the response (likely a low temperature for classification).

### Example Request Structure (Conceptual Python)

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                        "type": "base64",
                        "media_type": "image/jpeg", # or image/png
                        "data": "BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE_DATA"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Classify the primary waste item in this image. Provide its name, category (e.g., Wet Waste, Dry Recyclable, E-Waste, Hazardous), and a brief disposal instruction. Explain your reasoning."
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)

print(response.content)
```

### Response Parsing

The `AiService` will parse Claude's JSON (or structured text) response to extract the classification details and map them to the app's internal `WasteClassification` model.

## Considerations for Claude Integration

-   **API Costs**: Claude API calls have associated costs. Its use as a tertiary model helps manage this, but budget monitoring is essential.
-   **Latency**: API call latency will be a factor. The model orchestration logic should consider this, especially if Claude is invoked after timeouts from primary/secondary models.
-   **Prompt Engineering**: Effective prompting is crucial to get accurate and consistently formatted responses from Claude. This will require iteration.
-   **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API failures, rate limits, and unexpected response formats.
-   **Model Versioning**: Keep track of Claude model versions used and manage updates as new versions are released.
-   **Rate Limits**: Be aware of and manage API rate limits.

## When is Claude Invoked?

The `ModelOrchestrationLayer` (defined in `multi_model_ai_strategy.md` and implemented in `AiService`) will decide when to call Claude. This typically happens if:

1.  Gemini (Primary) and OpenAI (Secondary) both fail to provide a response (due to errors, timeouts, etc.).
2.  Gemini and OpenAI provide low-confidence scores, and the item is deemed complex enough to warrant a third opinion.
3.  A specific user setting or A/B test routes the request to Claude for evaluation purposes.

## Future Potential

-   **Detailed Explanations**: Leverage Claude's strong textual generation for more in-depth educational content related to a classified item.
-   **Conversational Interface**: If the app incorporates a chatbot for waste-related queries, Claude could be a strong candidate to power it.
-   **Complex Scenario Analysis**: For users uploading images of mixed waste or asking complex disposal questions, Claude's reasoning could be beneficial.

By integrating Claude as a tertiary option, the Waste Segregation App enhances its AI pipeline's resilience, accuracy for complex cases, and adaptability.
