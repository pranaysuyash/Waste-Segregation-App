# Go-Live Analysis - June 27, 2025

This document analyzes potential blockers for the go-live date of Sunday, June 29, 2025.

## Blockers

* **API Key Security:** The presence of API keys in the repository is a critical security vulnerability that must be addressed before going live. These keys should be immediately revoked and replaced with a secure method of managing secrets.
* **Incomplete Error Handling:** The large number of `TODO` comments related to error handling indicates that the app is not yet robust enough for a production environment. A thorough review and implementation of error handling is required.
* **Testing Gaps:** While there is a significant number of tests, there are still gaps in coverage, particularly in integration and end-to-end testing. These gaps should be addressed to ensure the app is stable and reliable.
* **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** A full dependency scan is needed to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a production environment.

## Recommendations

* **Prioritize Security:** The API key issue is the most critical blocker and should be addressed immediately.
* **Address Technical Debt:** The `TODO` comments and code duplication should be addressed to improve the long-term health of the codebase.
* **Increase Test Coverage:** Focus on increasing test coverage in critical areas of the application to reduce the risk of production issues.
