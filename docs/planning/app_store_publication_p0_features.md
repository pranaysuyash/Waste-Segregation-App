# P0 Features for App Store Publication

## Overview

After reviewing the codebase and documentation, this document outlines the two highest priority (P0) features that should be implemented before publishing the Waste Segregation App to app stores. These features are essential for market readiness and will ensure the app meets basic user expectations and app store requirements.

## 1. Privacy Policy & Terms of Service Implementation

### 1.1 Description

A comprehensive privacy policy and terms of service are mandatory requirements for app store publication. The app needs dedicated screens to display these legal documents and mechanisms to ensure user consent.

### 1.2 Justification

- **App Store Requirement**: Both Apple App Store and Google Play Store require a privacy policy for all apps
- **Legal Compliance**: Essential for GDPR, CCPA, and other data privacy regulations

- **Risk Mitigation**: Protects against potential legal issues

### 1.3 Implementation Details

#### 1.3.1 Privacy Policy Content
- Data collection practices (camera, images, classification history)
- Data storage and security measures
- Third-party services (Google API for authentication, AI services for classification)
- User rights and data access methods
- Deletion and data portability options
- Children's privacy considerations
- Contact information for privacy inquiries

#### 1.3.2 Terms of Service Content
- Usage restrictions and acceptable use
- User account responsibilities

## Versioning Strategy

### Initial Release Versioning

For the initial app store release, we recommend the following version scheme:

```
Version: 0.9.0 (90)
```

Where:
- `0.9.0` is the semantic version (major.minor.patch)
  - `0` major version indicates pre-1.0 status
  - `9` minor version indicates feature-complete beta
  - `0` patch level for initial release
- `90` is the build number (for internal tracking)

### Versioning Convention

Going forward, we recommend:

1. **Semantic Versioning**:
   - **Major version** (X.0.0): Significant changes or redesigns
   - **Minor version** (1.X.0): New features or substantial improvements
   - **Patch version** (1.0.X): Bug fixes and minor updates

2. **Build Numbers**:
   - Increment by 1 for each build submitted to app stores
   - Follow format: `Major*100 + Minor*10 + Patch`
   - Example: Version 1.2.3 would have build number 123

3. **Version Codes for Android**:
   - Single integer that must increase with each update
   - Use format: `Major*10000 + Minor*100 + Patch`
   - Example: Version 1.2.3 would be version code 10203

4. **TestFlight/Beta Versioning**:
   - Append `-beta.X` to semantic version for beta releases
   - Example: `1.2.0-beta.3`

5. **Version in App Display**:
   - Show semantic version in settings/about screen
   - Include build number in parentheses for support purposes
   - Example: "Version 1.2.3 (123)"

### Version Management Implementation

```dart
// Version constants (to be updated with each release)
class AppVersion {
  // Semantic version components
  static const int major = 0;
  static const int minor = 9;
  static const int patch = 0;
  
  // Build number (incremented with each build)
  static const int buildNumber = 90;
  
  // Android version code
  static const int versionCode = major * 10000 + minor * 100 + patch;
  
  // Full semantic version string
  static String get semanticVersion => '$major.$minor.$patch';
  
  // Display version (for UI)
  static String get displayVersion => '$semanticVersion ($buildNumber)';
  
  // Is this a beta version?
  static const bool isBeta = true;
  
  // Beta version suffix (if applicable)
  static const String betaSuffix = isBeta ? '-beta.1' : '';
  
  // Full version string with beta suffix
  static String get fullVersion => '$semanticVersion$betaSuffix';
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing these two P0 features will ensure the Waste Segregation App meets basic requirements for app store publication while providing a solid foundation for user experience. The privacy policy implementation addresses legal requirements, while the onboarding experience will significantly improve user retention and engagement.

With these features and the versioning strategy in place, the app will be well-positioned for a successful initial launch, with clear paths for future updates and improvements.
