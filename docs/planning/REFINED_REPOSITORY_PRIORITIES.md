  ☑️ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
  
  Required status checks:
  - build
  - test
  - golden_tests  
  - code_quality
  - trivy-scan (new)
  - performance-analysis (new)
  ```

### 2. Workflow Validation ⚠️

- **Action Required**: Test new workflows with sample PR
- **Steps**:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b test/validate-workflows
  echo "# Test" >> TEST.md
  git add TEST.md
  git commit -m "test: validate new CI workflows"
  git push origin test/validate-workflows
  # Create PR to see all new features
  ```

### 3. First Automated Release ⚠️

- **Action Required**: Tag version to trigger automated release
- **Steps**:

  ```bash
  # Update version in pubspec.yaml and CHANGELOG.md
  git add .
  git commit -m "chore: bump version to v2.2.5"
  git tag v2.2.5
  git push origin v2.2.5
