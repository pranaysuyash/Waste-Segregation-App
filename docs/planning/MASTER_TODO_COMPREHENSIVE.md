## 📋 **NOTES**

- **✅ ADDRESSED**: Firebase family service fully integrated into UI
- **✅ ADDRESSED**: User feedback widget integrated in result screen
- **⚠️ CRITICAL GAP**: Analytics service exists but no tracking calls active
- **✅ ADDRESSED**: Users now see Firebase-based family system instead of old Hive system
- **AdMob**: Critical blocker for production release
- **Code TODOs**: 40+ scattered throughout codebase need addressing
- **Testing**: Minimal test coverage, needs comprehensive testing strategy
- **Documentation**: Many features lack proper documentation

**Key Insight**: Firebase family UI integration is complete. Main focus now should be on analytics integration and adding tracking calls throughout the app to provide data-driven insights.
