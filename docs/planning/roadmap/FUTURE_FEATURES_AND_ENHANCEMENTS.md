## Future Leaderboard Types and Strategies

The leaderboard system can be expanded to support a variety of competitive and motivational experiences for users. Below are proposed leaderboard types and design considerations for future implementation:

### 1. Leaderboard Types

#### a. By Time Period
- **Daily Leaderboard**: Resets every day. Motivates daily engagement.
- **Weekly Leaderboard**: Resets every week. Rewards consistent participation.
- **Monthly Leaderboard**: Resets every month. Recognizes sustained effort.
- **All-Time Leaderboard**: Tracks lifetime achievements and points.

#### b. By Metric
- **Points Leaderboard**: Ranks users by total points earned (default).
- **Number of Analyses Leaderboard**: Ranks users by the number of waste items analyzed/classified, regardless of points.
- **Streak Leaderboard**: Ranks users by their current or best streak.
- **Achievements Leaderboard**: Ranks users by number of achievements or badges earned.

#### c. By Waste Type
- **Category-Specific Leaderboards**: Ranks users by points or analyses in a specific waste category (e.g., Plastic, Food Waste, E-Waste, etc.).
- **Recycling Leaderboard**: Focuses on recyclable items only.
- **Compost Leaderboard**: Focuses on compostable items only.

#### d. By Group
- **Family/Team Leaderboard**: Ranks users within a family or team.
- **Regional Leaderboard**: Ranks users within a city, state, or country.
- **Friends Leaderboard**: Ranks users among their friends (requires social features).

### 2. Data Model Considerations
- Each leaderboard type may require a separate Firestore collection or a composite key (e.g., `leaderboard_{period}_{metric}`).
- Category-specific leaderboards may use subcollections or indexed fields for efficient querying.
- Periodic leaderboards require scheduled resets (Cloud Functions or client logic).
- Group leaderboards require user-group mapping and privacy controls.

### 3. UI/UX Considerations
- Allow users to switch between leaderboard types via tabs or dropdowns.
- Clearly indicate the active leaderboard type and period.
- Show user's current rank even if not in the top N.
- Use badges or highlights for top performers in each category.
- Provide tooltips or info icons explaining each leaderboard type.

### 4. Gamification Implications
- Offer unique badges or rewards for top ranks in each leaderboard type.
- Encourage participation in underrepresented categories (e.g., composting).
- Use time-limited leaderboards for special events or campaigns.
- Enable users to set personal or group goals tied to leaderboard metrics.

### 5. Privacy and Fairness
- Allow users to opt out of public leaderboards or use anonymized display names.
- Implement anti-cheat measures for streaks and analysis counts.
- Consider regional balancing to avoid population bias in regional leaderboards.

### 6. Technical Implementation Notes
- Use Firestore triggers or scheduled Cloud Functions to reset and archive period-based leaderboards.
- Use aggregation queries or batch jobs for efficient ranking calculations.
- Consider caching leaderboard data for performance.

### 7. Example Leaderboard Schema
```json
{
  "userId": "abc123",
  "displayName": "Jane Doe",
  "photoUrl": "...",
  "points": 1234,
  "analyses": 567,
  "categoryBreakdown": {
    "Plastic": 200,
    "Food Waste": 150
  },
  "streak": 12,
  "achievements": 8,
  "period": "2024-06", // For monthly
  "leaderboardType": "monthly_points"
}
```

### 8. Next Steps
