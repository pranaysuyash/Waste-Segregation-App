# 🚀 Waste Segregation App - Priority TODOs & Enhancements

**Last Updated:** Jun 06, 2025
**Version:** 0.1.6+99

---

## 🔥 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES** (This Week - Original Items, Status Updated)

### 1. **User Feedback Mechanism Implementation** ✨
**Status**: DETAILED PLANNING COMPLETE (Was: IN-PROGRESS, widget created → Integration needed)
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for model training data
**Plan Document**: `docs/project/enhancements/classification_feedback_loop_plan.md`
**Original Files Ref**: `widgets/classification_feedback_widget.dart` (Widget itself is a component of the larger plan)

#### Original Implementation Tasks (Still relevant post-planning):
- [x] ✅ Create ClassificationFeedbackWidget with compact/full versions (as per original)
- [x] 🔄 Integrate feedback widget into result_screen.dart
- [x] 🔄 Add feedback button to history items
- [x] 🔄 Update storage service to handle feedback data (New collection: `classification_feedback`)
- [x] 🔄 Add analytics tracking for feedback collection
- [ ] 🔄 Test feedback collection workflow
- [ ] 🔄 Develop Admin Panel review workflow for feedback (New task from plan)
  - Implemented improved feedback submission handler with clearer error handling and cloud sync separation.
  - Added `ReviewStatus` enum for validation of feedback review status.

#### Original Features Included (Covered in plan):
- ✅ Compact feedback: Quick thumbs up/down with correction options
- ✅ Full feedback dialog: Detailed feedback with notes and custom corrections
- ✅ Smart correction options: Pre-populated common corrections
- ✅ Privacy-focused: Anonymous feedback for model training
- ✅ Visual feedback states: Shows existing feedback status

### 2. **LLM-Generated Disposal Instructions** 🤖
**Status**: PARTIALLY SUPERSEDED BY BROADER AI PLANNING (Was: TODO)
**Priority**: HIGH (Review specific needs against new AI content strategy)
**Impact**: Better disposal instructions quality
**Note**: The capability for AI-generated content, including disposal instructions, is now a core part of the `docs/project/enhancements/educational_content_strategy.md`. The Admin Panel (`docs/technical/admin_panel_design.md`) will manage this content. Specific LLM service details might still be relevant but should be integrated into that broader strategy.

#### Original Current Problem:
```dart
// Currently hardcoded in DisposalInstructionsGenerator
final basePreparation = [
  DisposalStep(
    instruction: 'Remove any non-organic materials...',
    // Hardcoded steps
  ),
];
```

#### Original Proposed Solution:
```dart
// New LLM service for dynamic instructions
class LLMDisposalService {
  Future<List<DisposalStep>> generatePreparationSteps({
    required String category,
    String? subcategory,
    String? materialType,
    String? location, // Bangalore-specific
  });
  
  Future<List<DisposalStep>> generateDisposalSteps({...});
  Future<List<SafetyWarning>> generateSafetyWarnings({...});
}
```

#### Original Implementation Tasks (Review against Educational Content Plan):
- [ ] 🔄 Create LLMDisposalService class (or integrate into broader AI service)
- [ ] 🔄 Define prompt templates for different waste categories
- [ ] 🔄 Add location-aware prompts (Bangalore-specific)
- [ ] 🔄 Implement caching for generated instructions
- [ ] 🔄 Add fallback to static instructions if LLM fails
- [ ] 🔄 Update DisposalInstructionsGenerator to use LLM (or new AI content service)

### 3. **Enhanced Interactive Tags System** 🏷️
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED (Advanced tag types added via TagFactory)
**Priority**: MEDIUM (Assess if covered by other UI/UX plans or still a distinct need)
**Note**: Review requirements against UI/UX plans for classification results, educational content display, and potentially gamification feedback. Enhancements might be integrated contextually rather than as a standalone "tags system" overhaul.

#### Original Current Tags:
- ✅ Category tags (Wet, Dry, Hazardous, etc.)
- ✅ Property tags (Recyclable, Compostable)
- ✅ Action tags (Similar Items, Filter)

#### Original Proposed New Tags:
```dart
// Environmental impact tags
TagFactory.environmentalImpact('Saves 2kg CO2', Colors.green);
TagFactory.recyclingDifficulty('Easy to recycle', DifficultyLevel.easy);

// Local information tags  
TagFactory.localInfo('BBMP collects Tuesdays', Icons.schedule);
TagFactory.nearbyFacility('2.3km away', Icons.location_on);

// User action tags
TagFactory.actionRequired('Clean before disposal', Colors.orange);
TagFactory.timeUrgent('Dispose within 24h', Colors.red);

// Educational tags
TagFactory.didYouKnow('Tip: Remove caps from bottles', Colors.blue);
TagFactory.commonMistake('Don't mix with food waste', Colors.amber);
```

#### Original Implementation Tasks (Review based on current UI/UX plans):
- [x] 🔄 Extend TagFactory with new tag types
- [x] 🔄 Add environmental impact calculation tags
- [x] 🔄 Implement local information tags (BBMP schedules, etc.)
- [x] 🔄 Add action-required and urgency tags
- [x] 🔄 Create educational tip tags
- [x] 🔄 Update InteractiveTagCollection to handle new types

  // Floating Action Button for quick capture
  static Widget buildCaptureFAB();
  
  // Material Design 3 components
  static Widget buildMaterial3Card();
  
  // Android-style app bar with overflow menu
  static Widget buildAndroidAppBar();
}
```

#### Proposed iOS Enhancements:
```dart
// iOS-specific UI elements  
class IOSSpecificUI {
  // Cupertino navigation bar
  static Widget buildCupertinoNavBar();
  
  // iOS-style tab bar at bottom
  static Widget buildCupertinoTabBar();
  
  // iOS modal presentation styles
  static void showIOSModalSheet(BuildContext context, Widget child);
