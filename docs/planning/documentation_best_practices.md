# Documentation Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for creating and maintaining documentation for the Waste Segregation App project. Following these guidelines will ensure consistency, quality, and usability of all project documentation.

## Documentation Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information should exist in only one place to avoid inconsistencies.
2. **Living Documentation**: Documentation should evolve alongside the product, never becoming stale.
3. **Audience-Oriented**: Content should be tailored to the specific audience (developers, designers, business stakeholders, end users).
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with high-level concepts before diving into details.
5. **Practical Examples**: Include concrete examples wherever possible.
6. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent format, style, and terminology across all documentation.
7. **Discoverability**: Documentation should be easy to find through clear organization and cross-referencing.
8. **Maintainability**: Keep documentation sustainable by making it easy to update.

## Document Structure

### File Organization

- Follow the established directory structure:
  - `technical/` - Technical implementation details
  - `user_experience/` - User-facing features and design
  - `business/` - Business strategy and models
  - `planning/` - Project planning and management
  - `reference/` - Reference documentation for users and developers

### Document Templates

All documentation should follow a consistent structure:

```markdown
# Document Title

## Overview
Brief summary of the document's purpose (1-2 paragraphs).

## Objectives
Clear statement of what the document aims to accomplish.

## Scope
What's included and what's not included in this document.

## [Main Content Sections]
The primary content of the document.

## Related Documents
Links to related documentation.

## Appendices (if applicable)
Additional information that supports the main content.

## Document Metadata
- Created: [Date]
- Last Updated: [Date]
- Author(s): [Names]
- Status: [Draft/In Review/Approved]
```

## Writing Style

### General Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language without unnecessary jargon
- Write in present tense, active voice
- Use second person ("you") when addressing the reader directly
- Break up text with headings, lists, and tables
- Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences)
- Use oxford commas for clarity
- Proofread for spelling and grammar errors

### Formatting

- Use Markdown formatting consistently:
  - `#` for top-level heading (document title)
  - `##` for main sections
  - `###` for subsections
  - `####` for minor sections
- Use backticks for code, command names, file names, and technical terms
- Use bold (**text**) for emphasis, not all caps or underlines
- Use italics (*text*) sparingly for new terms or slight emphasis
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bullet points for non-sequential items
- Use tables for structured data
- Keep line length to a maximum of 120 characters for better readability in code editors

### Code Examples

- Include meaningful comments
- Use syntax highlighting when possible
- Keep examples simple and focused on the specific concept
- Provide context for how the code fits into the larger system
- Test code examples to ensure they work as documented

## Technical Documentation

### Architecture Documents

- Clearly explain the reasoning behind architectural decisions
- Include diagrams using standard notation (UML, C4, etc.)
- Document both the ideal state and current implementation if they differ
- Address cross-cutting concerns (security, performance, etc.)
- Link to related technical specifications

### API Documentation

- Document all public APIs comprehensively
- Include request/response examples
- Document error states and handling
- Include authentication and authorization requirements
- Specify rate limits and performance characteristics

### Implementation Guides

- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Include prerequisites and system requirements
- Highlight potential issues and their solutions
- Provide validation steps to confirm successful implementation
- Include troubleshooting sections for common problems

## User Experience Documentation

### Design Specifications

- Include screenshots or mockups
- Document user flows with diagrams
- Specify exact measurements, colors, and typography
- Link to design system components
- Document interaction patterns and animations

### User Research

- Clearly state research objectives
- Document methodology and participant demographics
- Present findings objectively
- Include supporting data and quotes
- Connect findings to specific design recommendations

## Business Documentation

### Strategy Documents

- Clearly articulate goals and objectives
- Include market analysis and competitive positioning
- Document assumptions and their validation
- Include success metrics and KPIs
- Outline resource requirements and constraints

### Process Documentation

- Document the purpose of each process
- Specify roles and responsibilities
- Include workflow diagrams
- Document inputs, outputs, and dependencies
- Include timeframes and deadlines

## Documentation Review Process

### Before Submission

- Self-review for clarity, completeness, and correctness
- Check for adherence to these documentation standards
- Validate any code examples or technical procedures
- Ensure all links are functioning
- Verify that images and diagrams are clear and properly labeled

### Review Criteria

Documentation reviewers should evaluate:

1. **Technical accuracy** - Is all information correct?
2. **Completeness** - Does it cover the topic comprehensively?
3. **Clarity** - Is the information presented clearly?
4. **Structure** - Is the document well-organized?
5. **Consistency** - Does it follow documentation standards?
6. **Audience-appropriateness** - Is it suitable for the intended audience?

### Review Workflow

1. Author submits document for review
2. Reviewer(s) provide feedback
3. Author addresses feedback
4. Final review and approval
5. Publication to the documentation repository
6. Addition to the main README.md index if appropriate

## Documentation Maintenance

### Regular Updates

- Schedule quarterly reviews of all documentation
- Update documentation whenever related code or processes change
- Archive outdated documentation rather than deleting it
- Track documentation debt alongside technical debt

### Version Control

- Use clear commit messages for documentation changes
- Consider using branches for major documentation revisions
- Use pull requests for documentation reviews
- Tag documentation versions to align with software releases when appropriate

### Deprecation Process

1. Mark document as deprecated with a notice at the top
2. Include a link to the replacement document if applicable
3. Keep deprecated documents available for a reasonable transition period
4. Archive rather than delete to maintain historical record

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools

- **Markdown Editors**: VS Code with Markdown extensions, Typora
- **Diagram Tools**: draw.io, Mermaid, PlantUML
- **Screenshot Tools**: Snagit, macOS Screenshot, Windows Snipping Tool
- **Grammar Checkers**: Grammarly, Hemingway Editor

### Internal Resources

- Document templates in `/docs/templates/`
- Style guide reference at `/docs/planning/documentation_best_practices.md`
- Brand guidelines at `/docs/reference/brand_guidelines.md` (to be created)

## Conclusion

Good documentation is essential for project success, team collaboration, and product adoption. By following these best practices, we can ensure that our documentation remains a valuable asset for the Waste Segregation App project. These guidelines should evolve over time based on team feedback and changing project needs.

Remember: Documentation is a form of communication. The best documentation anticipates questions, provides clear answers, and guides the reader to successful outcomes.
