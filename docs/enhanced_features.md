   - Interactive elements for filtering and exploration
   - Responsive layout for different device sizes
   - Accessibility considerations for data visualization

### 2.4 Usage

The Waste Dashboard can be accessed through multiple entry points:

- From the home screen via the Dashboard button
- After classification from the result screen
- Through the app's main navigation
- From achievement screens for context-specific analytics

Users can:
- Filter data by time periods
- Explore waste composition through interactive charts
- Review personalized insights and recommendations
- Track progress toward waste reduction goals
- Share insights and achievements

## 3. Integration with Existing Features
