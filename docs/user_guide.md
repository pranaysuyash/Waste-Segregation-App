### Classification History

All waste items you analyze are now **automatically saved** to your history and will appear in the "Recent Identifications" section on the home screen. There's no need to manually save each classification - the app does this for you! This ensures that:

- You never lose your classification history
- All analyzed items contribute to your analytics dashboard
- Your waste insights are more comprehensive and accurate

The save button still appears on the classification result screen for confirmation, but will show "Saved" to indicate the item has already been stored.

### Dashboard Tabs

The dashboard consists of three main tabs:

#### 1. Overview Tab
