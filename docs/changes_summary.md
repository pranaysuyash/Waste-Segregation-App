# Recent Changes Summary

## Image Classification Caching Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Similarity Threshold
- Increased default Hamming distance threshold from 8 to 10 bits
- This allows for better recognition of the same objects photographed from slightly different angles
- Modified both `cache_service.dart` and `ai_service.dart` to use the new threshold

### 2. Improved Image Preprocessing
- Enhanced Gaussian blur radius from 2 to 3 for perceptual hashing
- The stronger blur reduces sensitivity to minor visual details that can change significantly with small angle variations
- This makes the perceptual hash algorithm more robust to minor differences

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed distance logging in `_findSimilarPerceptualHash` method
- Added statistics about hash comparison distances for better analysis
- Includes sorted distances and distribution information for debugging

### 4. Added Test Cases
- Added targeted tests for the similarity threshold functionality
- Tests verify both positive match cases (distance â‰¤ 10) and negative cases (distance > threshold)

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Fixed AchievementType Switch Statement
- Added missing cases for `metaAchievement`, `specialEvent`, `userGoal`, and `collectionMilestone` in the achievements screen
- Fixed compilation error in `achievements_screen.dart`
- Ensures all enum values are properly handled

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Updated technical specifications with new threshold values
- Added recent improvements section to CLAUDE.md
- Updated implementation details documentation
