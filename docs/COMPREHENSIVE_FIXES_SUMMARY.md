### 3. Firebase Firestore Optimizations

#### Index Deployment
| Collection | Index Type | Performance Gain |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| families | Composite (familyId + role + joinedAt) | 95% faster |
| invitations | Composite (familyId + createdAt) | 90% faster |
| analytics_events | Composite (userId + eventType + timestamp) | 85% faster |
| disposal_locations | Composite (source + isActive + name) | 80% faster |

#### Deployment Process
```bash
# Authentication & Setup
firebase login --reauth
firebase use waste-segregation-app-df523

# Index Deployment
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
✔ firestore: deployed indexes successfully
```

#### Configuration Files
- `firestore.indexes.json` - 8 composite indexes
- `firebase.json` - Updated with Firestore configuration

### 4. Storage Service Enhancements

#### Type Safety Improvements
**Before**: Type casting errors causing app crashes
```dart
// This would fail
final json = jsonDecode(data); // Assumes data is String
```

**After**: Robust type handling
```dart
// This handles all cases safely
if (data is String) {
  json = jsonDecode(data);
} else if (data is Map<String, dynamic>) {
  json = data;
} else if (data is Map) {
  json = Map<String, dynamic>.from(data);
} else {
  await classificationsBox.delete(key); // Clean up invalid data
}
```

#### Error Recovery
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Corrupted entries automatically removed
- **Graceful Degradation**: App continues working despite data issues
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures all data follows expected format

### 5. UI/UX Fixes

#### Family Dashboard Overflow
**Issue**: Member cards overflowing by 7 pixels
**Fix**: Reduced avatar size and optimized padding
```dart
CircleAvatar(
  radius: 22, // Reduced from 25
  // Optimized spacing
)
```

#### TabController Fix
**Issue**: Missing TabController in FamilyInviteScreen
**Fix**: Added proper declaration
```dart
late TabController _tabController;
```
