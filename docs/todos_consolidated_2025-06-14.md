- [ ] Image Segmentation Enhancement: Complete SAM integration, multi-object detection, and user controls (see `docs/planning/MASTER_TODO_COMPREHENSIVE.md`)
- [ ] "Re-Scan" Button on Results Screen: Let users re-run classification on the same image (e.g. after adjusting camera framing or lighting)
- [ ] Confidence Threshold Slider in Settings: Allow power users to adjust the minimum confidence at which the AI auto-classifies vs. prompts for manual review
- [ ] Batch Classification: Add a gallery multi-select so users can queue up several images at once for back-to-back classification

- [ ] Modern Design System Overhaul: Add dark mode, glassmorphism, micro-interactions, and dynamic theming (see `docs/planning/MASTER_TODO_COMPREHENSIVE.md`)
- [ ] Camera Permission Retry: If the user denies camera access, show a friendly in-app walkthrough on how to re-enable permissions
- [ ] Segmentation Fail States: Handle cases where no objects are detected (offer manual crop tool as fallback)
- [ ] Rate-Limit Feedback: If the LLM or Vision API throttles you, display a "please wait" indicator rather than a generic error

### Technical Debt & Security

- [ ] Performance & Memory Management: Optimize analytics, image caching, and memory leak prevention (see `docs/planning/MASTER_TODO_COMPREHENSIVE.md`)
- [ ] Error Handling & Resilience: Add comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, and data consistency checks (see `docs/planning/MASTER_TODO_COMPREHENSIVE.md`)
- [ ] Security Rules Testing: Automate Firestore rule tests in CI (e.g. via the Firebase Emulator Suite)

### CI/CD & Quality Gates
- [ ] Docs-Lint Workflow: Add a GitHub Action to fail the build if any TODOs remain in markdown or code (e.g. using markdown-todo-lint or a custom script)
- [ ] Code Quality Checks: Enforce dart analyze, flutter test --coverage, and dart_code_metrics on every PR (blocking merge if thresholds drop)

### Family & Social Features
- [ ] Family Management: Implement name editing, copy ID, toggle public/share, show member activity (see `docs/planning/MASTER_TODO_COMPREHENSIVE.md`)

- [ ] Achievements: Implement challenge generation and navigation to completed challenges (see `docs/planning/MASTER_TODO_COMPREHENSIVE.md`)

### Security & Privacy
- [ ] Data Protection: Add granular privacy settings, consent management, analytics opt-out, and data deletion/export tools (see `docs/planning/MASTER_TODO_COMPREHENSIVE.md`)
- [ ] Security Hardening: Input validation, SQL injection prevention, rate limiting, audit logging (see `docs/planning/MASTER_TODO_COMPREHENSIVE.md`)

### Offline & Sync Behavior
- [ ] Offline Queue: Cache scans and classification requests while offline, then auto-sync when connectivity returns
- [ ] Conflict Resolution UX: If a user edits or deletes an offline scan, provide in-app merge/conflict dialogs when syncing
- [ ] Connectivity Indicator: Show a subtle banner or icon when offline, with "reconnect to sync" call-to-action

- [ ] Restore Flow Tests: In emulator, archive ‚Üí delete ‚Üí restore ‚Üí assert user data and auth are fully back
- [ ] Inactive-Cleanup Cron Simulator: Add a test harness to fast-forward clock and run the cleanup, verifying logs

### Accessibility & Internationalization
- [ ] a11y Audit: Run an accessibility scanner (e.g. accessibility_test package) against key screens and surface failures as tasks

### User Feedback & Reporting
- [ ] In-App Feedback Widget: Let users flag a misclassification directly from the Results screen, sending image + category for review
- [ ] Usage Survey: After a few scans, prompt opt-in for a 1-minute survey on accuracy and feature requests

### Analytics & Telemetry
- [ ] Event Instrumentation: Track key events‚Äîscans started, scans succeeded, scans failed, re-analysis used, share actions‚Äîto inform product decisions
- [ ] Funnel Analysis: Add custom events around onboarding, first scan, and sharing to identify drop-off points

### Personalization & Settings
- [ ] Scan Presets: Allow users to save common "scan contexts" (e.g. kitchen vs. office) that pre-select disposal categories or filters
- [ ] Custom Categories: Enable power users to define new waste categories (e.g. "e-waste") and map them to existing disposal instructions

### Social & Sharing
- [ ] One-Tap Share: Build share cards (image + "I just recycled a plastic bottle!") for Instagram/WhatsApp
- [ ] Group Challenges: Allow users to "invite a friend" to a mini-challenge (e.g. "Recycle 10 items this week") directly from the app

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Crashlytics Verification: Beyond wiring, write a sanity check that ensures you're receiving real crash events (e.g. a test crash)
- [ ] Performance Benchmarks: Create a benchmark script to record image-segmentation latency on typical mid-range devices

### Dev-Phase Debug Tools
- [ ] Hidden Debug UI: Document and implement the /debug panel behind ENABLE_DEBUG_UI flag‚Äîlist the routes and stub out buttons
- [ ] Feature-Flag Config: Create a simple feature_flags.md listing all flags (enable_account_cleanup, enable_restore_ui, etc.) and their default settings

### Backup & Disaster Recovery
- [ ] Firestore Backup Validation: Write a small script or Cloud Function that periodically verifies your daily backups contain expected collections/doc counts
- [ ] Rollback Drill: Document and script a rollback procedure in case a migration goes wrong‚Äîtest it end-to-end in a staging project

### Documentation Gaps
- [ ] Feature-Flag Guide: Add a short doc (docs/admin/feature_flags.md) explaining how to flip flags, where they live, and the intended use
- [ ] Admin Panel Spec: If you haven't already, write up the high-level wireframe and API contract for the archive/restore screens in docs/admin/restore_spec.md
