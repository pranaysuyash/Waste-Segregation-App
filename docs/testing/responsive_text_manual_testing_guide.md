# Responsive Text Manual Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for manually testing the responsive text fixes for AppBar titles and greeting cards in the ReLoop.

## Source Of Truth

The implementation details that used to live in `docs/implementation/ui/widgets/responsive_appbar_title.md` were folded into this guide so the behavior contract and verification checklist stay in one place.

Current implementation anchors:
- `lib/widgets/responsive_text.dart`
- `lib/screens/web_fallback_screen.dart`
- `lib/web_standalone.dart`
- `widgetbook/main.dart`

Behavior summary:
- `ResponsiveAppBarTitle` abbreviates on very narrow widths below 200px.
- `GreetingText` checks for overflow before switching to auto-sizing.
- `ResponsiveText.cardTitle` exists as a preset, but active production usage is still limited.
- The base `ResponsiveText` wrapper supports `semanticsLabel`.

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Flutter development environment
- Physical devices or emulators with different screen sizes
- Access to device developer options for font size changes

### Recommended Test Devices
1. **Small Screen**: iPhone SE (320x568) or similar Android device
2. **Medium Screen**: iPhone 8 (375x667) or Pixel 3
3. **Large Screen**: iPhone 11 Pro Max (414x896) or Pixel 6 Pro
4. **Tablet**: iPad (768x1024) or Android tablet

## Test Cases

### 1. AppBar Title Tests

#### Test 1.1: Normal App Name Display
**Objective**: Verify the default app name displays correctly without overflow

**Steps**:
1. Launch the app on a standard device (iPhone 8 or similar)
2. Navigate to the home screen
3. Observe the AppBar title

**Expected Result**:
- "ReLoop" displays fully without truncation
- Text is centered and readable
- No visual overflow or clipping

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Title is fully visible and properly formatted

---

#### Test 1.2: Long App Name Handling
**Objective**: Test how the app handles extended app names

**Steps**:
1. Temporarily modify `AppStrings.appName` to "ReLoop Pro Edition with Advanced Features"
2. Hot reload the app
3. Check AppBar on different screen sizes

**Expected Result**:
- Text automatically resizes to fit available space
- Minimum font size maintained for readability
- No text overflow or clipping occurs

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Long title adapts gracefully to screen constraints

---

#### Test 1.3: Very Narrow Screen Test
**Objective**: Verify AppBar behavior on extremely narrow screens

**Steps**:
1. Use iPhone SE or set emulator to 320px width
2. Test with both normal and long app names
3. Rotate device to landscape mode

**Expected Result**:
- Title abbreviates appropriately (e.g., "WS" for "ReLoop")
- Abbreviation is readable and makes sense
- No layout breaking or crashes

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Graceful degradation on narrow screens

#### Contract Note

The current implementation uses a 200px breakpoint in `ResponsiveAppBarTitle`:
- multi-word titles are abbreviated from the first letter of each word
- single long words are truncated with ellipsis after the first 10 characters
- the title remains single-line with ellipsis overflow

When testing, confirm the exact visible result rather than only checking that a widget rendered.

### 2. Greeting Card Tests

#### Test 2.1: Standard Greeting Display
**Objective**: Verify normal greeting behavior with typical usernames

**Steps**:
1. Sign in with a normal username (e.g., "John", "Sarah")
2. Test at different times of day:
   - Morning (before 12 PM): "Good Morning"
   - Afternoon (12-5 PM): "Good Afternoon"  
   - Evening (after 5 PM): "Good Evening"
3. Observe greeting card on home screen

**Expected Result**:
- Greeting changes based on time of day
- Username displays correctly
- Text fits within card boundaries
- Icon matches time of day

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Dynamic greetings work correctly with normal usernames

---

#### Test 2.2: Long Username Handling
**Objective**: Test greeting card with very long usernames

**Steps**:
1. Create test account with long username: "AVeryLongUserNameThatShouldCauseTextOverflow"
2. Navigate to home screen
3. Test on different screen sizes
4. Check both modern and classic home screen layouts

**Expected Result**:
- Text automatically wraps to multiple lines (max 2)
- Font size reduces if necessary to maintain readability
- No text clipping or overflow
- Card layout remains intact

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Long usernames handled gracefully without breaking layout

---

#### Test 2.3: Narrow Screen Greeting Test
**Objective**: Verify greeting card behavior on narrow screens

**Steps**:
1. Use narrow device or emulator (320px width)
2. Test with various username lengths
3. Check both portrait and landscape orientations

**Expected Result**:
- Greeting text adapts to available space
- Icon and text remain properly aligned
- Card maintains visual hierarchy
- Text remains readable

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Greeting card responsive on narrow screens

#### Contract Note

`GreetingText` first measures the full greeting with `TextPainter` and only uses auto-sizing when the text exceeds the available width.

When testing, confirm:
- the greeting remains readable at narrow widths
- the max line behavior stays at 2
- the fallback path still renders the full greeting when it fits

---

### 3. Accessibility Tests

#### Test 3.1: Screen Reader Compatibility
**Objective**: Ensure responsive text works with screen readers

**Steps**:
1. Enable VoiceOver (iOS) or TalkBack (Android)
2. Navigate to home screen
3. Focus on AppBar title and greeting card
4. Verify screen reader announces content correctly

**Expected Result**:
- Screen reader announces full app name
- Greeting text is read as complete sentence
- No truncated or garbled announcements

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Full accessibility maintained

#### Contract Note

The base `ResponsiveText` API supports `semanticsLabel`, but the specialized wrappers should still be checked for the semantic output users hear in practice.

---

#### Test 3.2: Font Size Accessibility
**Objective**: Test with system font size changes

**Steps**:
1. Go to device Settings > Accessibility > Font Size
2. Set to largest available font size
3. Return to app and check text display
4. Test with smallest font size as well

**Expected Result**:
- App respects system font size preferences
- Text remains readable at all sizes
- Layout adapts appropriately
- No text overflow occurs

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Responsive to system font size changes

#### Contract Note

This guide should be used to verify whether the UI remains readable at device font extremes without relying only on the golden files.

---

### 4. Performance Tests

#### Test 4.1: Smooth Rendering
**Objective**: Verify responsive text doesn't impact performance

**Steps**:
1. Navigate rapidly between screens
2. Rotate device multiple times
3. Switch between apps and return
4. Monitor for any lag or stuttering

**Expected Result**:
- Smooth transitions and animations
- No noticeable performance degradation
- Text renders quickly and consistently

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ No performance impact from responsive text

#### Contract Note

The performance claim in the implementation doc is conditional, not absolute. Treat this as a sanity check against obvious rebuild or overflow regressions, not a full benchmark.

---

### 5. Edge Case Tests

#### Test 5.1: Empty Username Handling
**Objective**: Test behavior with missing or empty usernames

**Steps**:
1. Test guest mode
2. Test with account that has no display name
3. Check fallback behavior

**Expected Result**:
- Graceful fallback to "Guest" or "User"
- No crashes or empty greetings
- Consistent formatting maintained

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Handles edge cases gracefully

---

#### Test 5.2: Special Characters in Username
**Objective**: Test with usernames containing special characters

**Steps**:
1. Test with usernames containing:
   - Emojis: "John 😊"
   - Special characters: "María José"
   - Numbers: "User123"
   - Mixed case: "CamelCaseUser"

**Expected Result**:
- All character types display correctly
- Text measurement works accurately
- No encoding or display issues

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Special characters handled correctly

#### Contract Note

If a username or title looks short but contains punctuation or unusual spacing, verify the visible text and not just the raw string equality.

## Automated Test Verification

After manual testing, run the automated tests to ensure consistency:

```bash
# Run widget tests
flutter test test/widgets/responsive_text_test.dart

# Run golden tests (generates reference images)
flutter test test/golden/responsive_text_golden_test.dart

# Update golden files if needed
flutter test test/golden/responsive_text_golden_test.dart --update-goldens
```

Relevant automated coverage today:
- `test/widgets/responsive_text_test.dart`
- `test/golden/responsive_text_golden_test.dart`
- `test/ui_consistency/comprehensive_overflow_test.dart` is currently skipped and should be treated as a stale coverage stub until migrated.

## Success Criteria

The responsive text implementation is considered successful when:

1. ✅ All manual test cases pass on all target devices
2. ✅ Automated tests pass consistently
3. ✅ No performance degradation observed
4. ✅ Accessibility requirements met
5. ✅ Visual consistency maintained across screen sizes
6. ✅ No text overflow or clipping in any scenario
7. ✅ Graceful degradation on edge cases
