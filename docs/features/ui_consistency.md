# UI Consistency & SafeArea Improvements

**Version:** 1.2.0  
**Date:** 2024-06-04

## Summary
- Main content in `HomeScreen` is now wrapped in a `SafeArea` (bottom: true).
- The `ModernBottomNavigation` widget is also wrapped in a `SafeArea` (bottom: true).
- Removed hardcoded `SizedBox(height: 100)` bottom padding from the main content column.

## Benefits
- Prevents any main content from being hidden behind the bottom navigation bar on all devices.
- Ensures the navigation bar itself is never overlapped by system UI (gesture navigation, etc).
- Improves accessibility and UI consistency for all users.
- No more reliance on hardcoded padding for layout safety.

## Testing
- All UI, accessibility, and overflow tests pass after this change.
- Manual and automated tests confirm no content is hidden or clipped by navigation elements.
