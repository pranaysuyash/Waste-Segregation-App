   - `ImpactCalculationService`: Calculate environmental impact metrics

### UI Enhancements

1. **Achievement Screen**
   - Add filtering/sorting options (earned/unearned, by type, by rarity)
   - Implement tiered achievement visualization
   - Add claim reward button for unclaimed achievements
   - Add special effects for rare achievements

2. **New Screens**
   - `LeaderboardScreen`: Display various leaderboard types
   - `WasteDexScreen`: Display collection progress
   - `DailyQuestScreen`: Show daily quests and bonuses
   - `TeamScreen`: Manage team participation
   - `UserGoalsScreen`: Set and track personal goals
   - `ImpactVisualizationScreen`: Show environmental impact

3. **Home Screen Enhancements**
   - Add XP progress bar
   - Add daily challenge/quest widget
   - Add streak visualization with dynamic effects

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements

1. **Tiered Achievements System**
   - Extend Achievement model with tier support
   - Modify achievement display to show tier information
   - Implement progression between tiers
   - Add hidden/secret achievement support

2. **Enhanced Challenges**
   - Expand challenge types (classification, knowledge, streak, etc.)
   - Add difficulty tiers
   - Create themed challenges
   - Implement better progress visualization

3. **Streak Improvements**
   - Implement escalating rewards
   - Add streak saver feature
   - Enhance visual feedback

### Phase 2: Social & Engagement Enhancements

1. **Leaderboards**
   - Implement basic leaderboard infrastructure
   - Create weekly, monthly, and all-time leaderboards
   - Add friend leaderboards (once friend system is in place)
   - Create leaderboard UI with filters

2. **Daily Engagement**
   - Implement daily login bonuses
   - Create daily quests system
   - Add notification support for daily activities

3. **Collections System**
   - Create "WasteDex" model and infrastructure
   - Design collection UI
   - Implement collection unlocks and rewards

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. **Community Features**
   - Implement team/community challenges
   - Add social sharing functionality
   - Create friend gifting/cheering system

2. **Personalization**
   - Implement personalized challenges
   - Add user-set goals
   - Create environmental impact visualization

3. **Reward Systems**
   - Implement virtual currency (optional)
   - Create in-app shop (if currency is implemented)
   - Add narrative/story unlocks

## Technical Considerations

### Data Storage

- Use Hive for local storage of gamification data
- Consider Firebase for cross-device synchronization and leaderboards
- Implement proper serialization for all new models

### Performance

- Lazy-load leaderboard data
- Use efficient data structures for collection tracking
- Cache achievement progress calculations
- Implement background processing for impact calculations

### User Experience

- Provide immediate feedback for achievements
- Ensure smooth animations for rewards
- Implement proper error handling for network-dependent features
- Design clear and informative progress indicators

## Feature Dependencies

| Feature | Dependencies | Priority |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Tiered Achievements | Achievement model updates | High |
| Enhanced Challenges | Challenge model updates | High |
| Leaderboards | Firebase integration | High |
| Daily Quests | Notification system | High |
| Collection System | WasteClassification enhancements | Medium |
| Team Challenges | User authentication, Firebase | Medium |
| Environmental Impact | Waste classification history | High |
| Virtual Currency | In-app shop design | Low |

## Future Extensibility

This architecture is designed to support future enhancements such as:

- AR-based collection experiences
- Seasonal events and limited-time challenges
- Cross-app gamification integration
- Real-world rewards and partnerships
- Machine learning for personalized challenge difficulty
- Social media competition and challenges

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for achievement progression logic
- Widget tests for new UI components
- Integration tests for leaderboard functionality
- User testing for engagement metrics
- A/B testing for reward systems
- Performance testing for collection system with large datasets

## Rollout Strategy

1. Implement high-priority enhancements first
2. Release features in logical groups to allow user adaptation
3. Collect feedback after each phase
4. Adjust subsequent phases based on user engagement data
5. Prioritize features that drive daily active usage

## Success Metrics

- Increased daily active users
- Improved 7-day retention rate
- Higher average session duration
- Increased classification count per user
- More social shares
- Higher challenge completion rate
- Better educational content engagement
