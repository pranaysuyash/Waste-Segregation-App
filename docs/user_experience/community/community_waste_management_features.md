  final String neighborhood;
  final GeoPoint location;
  final List<String> collectionDays; // e.g., "Monday", "Thursday"
  final TimeRange collectionTimeRange;
  final WasteType wasteType;
  final String collectorInfo;
  final bool isVerified;
  final int verificationCount;
  final DateTime lastUpdated;
  final String updatedBy;
  
  // Methods for schedule manipulation
}

enum WasteType {
  general,
  recyclable,
  organic,
  hazardous,
  bulky,
