# User Flows Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation of user flows for the Waste Segregation App, outlining the step-by-step journeys users take when interacting with the application.

## Purpose

User flows are visual representations of the paths users follow to accomplish specific tasks within the app. They help:

- Ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience
- Identify potential usability issues before implementation
- Guide development priorities and feature design
- Communicate the intended user experience to all stakeholders
- Identify integration points between different app features

## Contents

This directory contains the following user flow documentation:

- [**Current User Flows**](./current_user_flows.md): Detailed flows for all implemented features in the current version of the app
- [**Future User Flows**](./future_user_flows.md): Planned flows for upcoming features on the development roadmap

## User Flow Structure

Each user flow follows a consistent documentation format:

1. **Purpose Statement**: A clear explanation of what the flow accomplishes for the user
2. **Visual Flow Diagram**: ASCII diagram showing the connection between screens and decision points
3. **Detailed Steps**: Step-by-step explanation of each screen and interaction in the flow
4. **Integration Points**: How the flow connects with other features in the app

## Using These Documents

### For Designers
- Use as reference when creating screen designs and interaction patterns
- Ensure designs accommodate all possible paths in the flows
- Identify opportunities for improving transitions between screens

### For Developers
- Understand the complete context of features being implemented
- Ensure all necessary screens and states are accounted for
- Verify that navigation between screens matches the intended flow

### For QA and Testing
- Create test cases that cover all paths in each flow
- Verify that implemented flows match the documented design intent
- Identify edge cases by analyzing decision points in flows

## Maintaining User Flows

When updating user flows:

1. Always update the appropriate document based on whether the feature is currently implemented or planned
2. If a future flow becomes implemented, move it from the future to the current document
3. Use consistent formatting and diagram styles for readability
4. Include accessibility considerations for each flow
5. Document error states and recovery paths
