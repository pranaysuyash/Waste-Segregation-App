# üõ†Ô∏è TODO Management Automation ‚Äî 2025-06-14

This document describes the process for automating the management of TODOs and actionable tasks in the codebase and documentation, including automated GitHub Issue creation, mapping, and ongoing maintenance.

---

## 1. Overview

All actionable TODOs are consolidated in `docs/todos_consolidated_2025-06-14.md`, grouped by priority and category. This automation process ensures every TODO is tracked as a GitHub Issue, with bi-directional mapping and clear documentation.

---

## 2. Automated Issue Creation & Sync

### 2.1 Extraction & Categorization
- Parse all TODOs from the consolidated file.
- Categorize by priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW), type (feature, technical debt, i18n, etc.), and file/line reference (for code TODOs).

### 2.2 Issue Creation
- For each TODO, create a GitHub Issue with:
  - **Title:** Short summary of the TODO
  - **Description:**
    - Original TODO text
    - Category and priority
    - File and line number (if applicable)
    - Link to the consolidated TODO file and relevant planning docs
  - **Labels:** Priority, category, and any custom tags
- Use a script or GitHub API for batch creation and updates.

### 2.3 Mapping Table
- Maintain a mapping table (see below) to link TODOs and GitHub Issues.
- Update the table whenever issues are created, closed, or TODOs are updated.

#### Mapping Table Template

| TODO Description | Category | Priority | File/Line | GitHub Issue #/URL |
|------------------|----------|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| LLM-Generated Disposal Instructions | AI & Core Features | HIGH | N/A | [#123](https://github.com/yourrepo/issues/123) |
| [dialog_helper.dart:2] Uncomment when gen_l10n is properly set up | i18n & Localization | CODE | dialog_helper.dart:2 | [#124](https://github.com/yourrepo/issues/124) |

---

## 3. Maintenance & Best Practices

- **Sync Regularly:** Re-run the extraction and issue creation script after major merges or documentation updates.
- **Bi-directional Linking:** Always reference the GitHub Issue in the TODO file and vice versa.
- **Close Issues on Completion:** When a TODO is completed, close the corresponding issue and update the mapping table.
- **Batch Updates:** For large refactors, batch update issues and TODOs to avoid drift.
- **Documentation:** Update this file with any process changes, new automation scripts, or best practices.

---

## 4. How to Run the Automation

1. Run the extraction script to parse `docs/todos_consolidated_2025-06-14.md`.
2. Use the provided script or GitHub API to create/update issues.
3. Update the mapping table below.
4. Review and triage new issues as needed.

## 7. Sprint Planning & Progress Tracking

### 7.1 Process
- Select HIGH and MEDIUM priority TODOs for the upcoming sprint (e.g., 1-2 weeks).
- Create a markdown sprint board with columns: Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done.
- Track progress by moving TODOs/issues between columns.

### 7.2 Template
```markdown
# Sprint Board ‚Äî YYYY-MM-DD

## Backlog
- [ ] TODO/Issue 1
- [ ] TODO/Issue 2

## In Progress
- [ ] TODO/Issue 3

## Review
- [ ] TODO/Issue 4

## Done
- [x] TODO/Issue 5
```

### 7.3 Best Practices
- Review and update the board daily.
- Link each item to its GitHub Issue.
- Use checklists for subtasks.

---

## 8. Custom Filtering & Reporting

### 8.1 Process
- Filter TODOs/issues by category, priority, file, or assignee.
- Export filtered lists to CSV or markdown for reporting.

### 8.2 Template
| TODO | Category | Priority | File | Status |
|------|----------|----------|------|--------|
| ...  | ...      | ...      | ...  | ...    |

### 8.3 Best Practices
- Use filters to prioritize work and identify bottlenecks.
- Share reports with the team at sprint reviews.

---

## 9. Automated PR/Commit Checks

### 9.1 Process
- Add a pre-commit or CI script to block merges if new TODOs are added without an associated GitHub Issue.
- Use linting or custom scripts to enforce this rule.

### 9.2 Example (pseudocode)
```bash
git diff --cached | grep 'TODO' | while read line; do
  # Check if TODO is linked to an issue
  # Block commit if not
  ...
done
```

### 9.3 Best Practices
- Document the check in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Allow overrides for urgent hotfixes (with explanation).

---

## 10. Batch Refactoring & Cleanup

### 10.1 Process
- Identify batch-fixable TODOs (e.g., i18n, code style).
- Use scripts or IDE tools for batch refactoring.
- Track progress in the mapping table and sprint board.

### 10.2 Best Practices
- Test thoroughly after batch changes.
- Update documentation and mapping table.

---

## 11. Documentation & Knowledge Base Automation

### 11.1 Process
- Auto-link TODOs/issues to relevant docs/specs.
- Update architecture diagrams, changelogs, and ADRs as features are completed.

### 11.2 Best Practices
- Keep documentation in sync with code and issues.
- Use scripts to automate doc updates where possible.

---

## 12. Team Collaboration & Assignment

### 12.1 Process
- Assign TODOs/issues based on file/module ownership or expertise.
- Track assignments in the mapping table and sprint board.

### 12.2 Best Practices
- Rotate assignments for learning.
- Use GitHub assignees and reviewers.

---

## 13. Advanced Search & Navigation

### 13.1 Process
- Provide a search index for all TODOs/issues with code/doc links.
- Use scripts or tools for fast navigation.

### 13.2 Best Practices
- Update the index after major refactors.
- Link search results to mapping table and sprint board.

---

## 14. Continuous Improvement Suggestions

### 14.1 Process
- Analyze TODO/issue patterns for recurring problems.
- Suggest process or codebase improvements.

### 14.2 Best Practices
- Review improvement suggestions at retrospectives.
- Document adopted changes in this file.

---

## 15. Custom Workflows & Integrations

### 15.1 Process
- Integrate with Slack, Jira, Notion, or other tools as needed.
- Use webhooks or APIs for automation.

### 15.2 Best Practices
- Document all integrations and workflows.
- Review integrations quarterly for relevance and efficiency.
