- **Data Visualization**: fl_chart package for waste analytics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Android or iOS device/emulator

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranaysuyash/Waste-Segregation-App.git
   cd waste_segregation_app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Generate model code:

   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build
   ```

4. Configure API keys:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the project root.
   - Add your API keys and other environment-specific configurations to this file. Example:

     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
     # For AI model selection (see lib/utils/constants.dart for defaults if not set)
     OPENAI_API_MODEL_PRIMARY=gpt-4.1-nano
     OPENAI_API_MODEL_SECONDARY=gpt-4o-mini
     OPENAI_API_MODEL_TERTIARY=gpt-4.1-mini
     GEMINI_API_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
     # Firebase (if specific env vars are needed beyond google-services.json)
     # FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
     # FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
     ```

   - The application loads these variables at runtime. API authentication uses the standard Bearer token format, handled by the `AIService`.

5. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env
   ```

### Utility Scripts

The project root contains several utility shell scripts for development and maintenance tasks, including:

- `build_production.sh`: Helps create production builds for different platforms (APK, App Bundle, iOS).
- `run_with_env.sh`: Validates the `.env` file and runs the app with error checking.
- `fix_kotlin_build_issue.sh`: (Purpose to be documented if known, likely for specific Kotlin-related build problems).
- `fix_play_store_signin.sh`: (Purpose to be documented if known, likely for Google Play Sign-In configuration issues).
- `test_low_hanging_fruits.sh`: (Purpose to be documented if known, likely for running a subset of quick tests).

Refer to the scripts themselves for their specific functionalities.

## Project Structure

The `lib/` directory contains the core Dart code for the application, organized into subdirectories for:

- `models/`: Data structures and classes.
- `providers/`: State management using the Provider package.
- `screens/`: UI for different application screens.
- `services/`: Business logic, API interactions, and other services (e.g., AI, storage, gamification).

## Overview

This cross-platform app allows users to capture or upload images, then uses an AI model (primarily `gpt-4.1-nano` via OpenAI, with a 4-tier fallback system including other OpenAI models and ultimately Google's `gemini-2.0-flash`) to identify items and classify them into waste categories:

- Wet Waste (organic, compostable)
- Dry Waste (recyclable)
- Hazardous Waste (requires special handling)
- Medical Waste (potentially contaminated)
- Non-Waste (reusable items, edible food)

The app provides educational content about each category, stores classification data locally using Hive, synchronizes core data (like classifications, user profiles, and community activity) in real-time with Firebase Firestore for signed-in users, and offers an optional full data backup/restore feature using Google Drive.

## Accessibility & Color Contrast

- All screens have been updated for improved color contrast and text visibility.
- The app now meets accessibility standards for color contrast in both light and dark themes.

## Technical Implementation

- **Framework**: Flutter
- **State Management**: Provider
- **Local Storage**: Hive
- **Backend Services**: Firebase for authentication and Firebase Firestore for real-time cloud data storage and synchronization.
- **Image Handling**: image_picker package
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes multiple AI models for image classification. Primarily uses OpenAI models (e.g., `gpt-4.1-nano`) called via direct HTTP requests to the OpenAI API. A 4-tier fallback system is in place, which includes other OpenAI models and ultimately Google's `gemini-2.0-flash` model, accessed via its specific Google AI API endpoint. (The `openai_api` package is listed in dependencies but current `AIService` implementation uses direct HTTP calls).
- **Google Integration**: google_sign_in package with Firebase authentication
- **Data Visualization**: fl_chart package for waste analytics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Android or iOS device/emulator

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranaysuyash/Waste-Segregation-App.git
   cd waste_segregation_app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Generate model code:

   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build
   ```

4. Configure API keys:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the project root.
   - Add your API keys and other environment-specific configurations to this file. Example:

     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
     # For AI model selection (see lib/utils/constants.dart for defaults if not set)
     OPENAI_API_MODEL_PRIMARY=gpt-4.1-nano
     OPENAI_API_MODEL_SECONDARY=gpt-4o-mini
     OPENAI_API_MODEL_TERTIARY=gpt-4.1-mini
     GEMINI_API_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
     # Firebase (if specific env vars are needed beyond google-services.json)
     # FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
     # FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
     ```

   - The application loads these variables at runtime. API authentication uses the standard Bearer token format, handled by the `AIService`.

5. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env
   ```

### Utility Scripts

The project root contains several utility shell scripts for development and maintenance tasks, including:

- `build_production.sh`: Helps create production builds for different platforms (APK, App Bundle, iOS).
- `run_with_env.sh`: Validates the `.env` file and runs the app with error checking.
- `fix_kotlin_build_issue.sh`: (Purpose to be documented if known, likely for specific Kotlin-related build problems).
- `fix_play_store_signin.sh`: (Purpose to be documented if known, likely for Google Play Sign-In configuration issues).
- `test_low_hanging_fruits.sh`: (Purpose to be documented if known, likely for running a subset of quick tests).

Refer to the scripts themselves for their specific functionalities.

## Project Structure

The `lib/` directory contains the core Dart code for the application, organized into subdirectories for:

- `models/`: Data structures and classes.
- `providers/`: State management using the Provider package.
- `screens/`: UI for different application screens.
- `services/`: Business logic, API interactions, and other services (e.g., AI, storage, gamification).
- `utils/`: Utility functions, constants, and helpers.
- `widgets/`: Reusable UI components, including common, modern, and advanced UI elements.
- `main.dart`: The main entry point of the application.
