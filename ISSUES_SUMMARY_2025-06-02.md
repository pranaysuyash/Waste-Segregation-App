## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (RELEASE BLOCKERS)

### 1.1 **CRITICAL: Test Suite Failure (Partially Resolved)**
- **Impact**: Test suite had 0% success rate, now partially fixed with model tests resolved
- **Details**: 
  - ‚úÖ **Model tests**: Fixed compilation errors and API mismatches
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Service tests**: Firebase integration issues remain
  - ‚ùå **Widget tests**: Still failing or timing out
  - ‚ùå **Integration tests**: Still failing or timing out
  - ‚ùå **Performance tests**: Still failing or timing out
  - This remains a **RELEASE BLOCKER** until service and widget tests are fixed
- **Progress**: Model test compilation errors resolved, service tests 30% complete

### 1.2 Play Store Google Sign-In Certificate Mismatch
- **Impact**: Users are unable to sign in via Google when the app is deployed through the Play Store due to a certificate mismatch.
- **Details**: The app requires the Play Store SHA-1 certificate to be added to the Firebase Console. Without this, authentication fails with a specific error code. This is a release blocker.

### 1.3 AdMob Configuration Missing
- **Impact**: The app currently uses test ad unit IDs and lacks GDPR compliance and consent management, making it unfit for production release.
- **Details**: There are 15+ TODOs in the AdMob service, including replacing test IDs, implementing GDPR compliance, and adding reward ad functionality. These are critical for monetization and legal compliance.

### 1.4 Firebase UI Integration Gap
- **Impact**: Firebase backend services exist but are not fully integrated into the app's UI, limiting user access to key features.
- **Details**: UI placeholders exist without real functionality, and some integrations (like Facebook SAM and multi-object detection) are incomplete.

### 1.5 Performance - Offline Mode Hang
- **Impact**: Enabling offline mode causes the app to freeze for over 16 seconds, severely affecting user experience.
- **Details**: The app needs background downloading with a progress indicator to resolve this issue.

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 2.1 **Code Quality: 342 Linter Issues**
- **Impact**: 342 linter issues detected, mostly deprecated `withOpacity` usage
- **Details**: While not critical errors, these affect code maintainability and future Flutter compatibility
- **Status**: Color extensions with `withValues` method available but not fully implemented across codebase

### 2.2 Location Services Missing
- **Impact**: The app cannot provide location-based disposal facilities due to missing GPS permissions, hardcoded distance calculations, and lack of maps integration.
- **Details**: There is no geolocator dependency, and maps integration is only marked as a TODO.

### 2.3 Firebase Security Rules
- **Impact**: Data in Firestore is not properly secured, risking user privacy and data integrity.
- **Details**: Comprehensive security rules, user data access control, and family data isolation are needed.

### 2.4 Platform-Specific UI Missing
- **Impact**: The app uses the same Material Design for both iOS and Android, missing native UI elements and platform detection.
- **Details**: This affects user experience and platform consistency.

### 2.5 Visual Style Guide Violations
- **Impact**: Inconsistent use of colors and styling across the app.
- **Details**: Some categories do not follow the visual style guide, and button colors are inconsistent.

### 2.6 Memory Management
- **Impact**: Potential memory leaks and performance issues with large data sets and image caching.
- **Details**: No lazy loading for analytics and unoptimized image caching.

## 3. Medium Priority Issues

### 3.1 Dark Mode Support

### 3.3 Loading States Minimal
- **Impact**: Minimal loading indicators lead to poor perceived performance.

### 3.4 Chart Accessibility
- **Impact**: Charts are not readable by screen readers, affecting accessibility for visually impaired users.

- **Status**: ‚úÖ Partially improved - replaced print with debugPrint

### 5.2 Layout and Overflow Issues
- **Impact**: Text and widgets may overflow on narrow screens or with long content, affecting usability.

### 5.3 State Management Validation

### 5.4 Error Handling and Logging
- **Impact**: Error handling is incomplete in some services, and logging may not be production-ready.

### 5.5 Accessibility and Usability
- **Impact**: Incomplete accessibility support, including color contrast, screen reader compatibility, and proper semantics.
