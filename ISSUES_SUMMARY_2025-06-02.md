# ðŸš¨ Code and Documentation Issues Summary (2025-06-02)

This document lists all known issues, technical debt, and improvement areas identified in the codebase and documentation as of June 2, 2025. Each issue is described in detail for clarity and future resolution.

## 1. Critical Issues

### 1.1 Play Store Google Sign-In Certificate Mismatch
- **Impact**: Users are unable to sign in via Google when the app is deployed through the Play Store due to a certificate mismatch.
- **Details**: The app requires the Play Store SHA-1 certificate to be added to the Firebase Console. Without this, authentication fails with a specific error code. This is a release blocker.

### 1.2 AdMob Configuration Missing
- **Impact**: The app currently uses test ad unit IDs and lacks GDPR compliance and consent management, making it unfit for production release.
- **Details**: There are 15+ TODOs in the AdMob service, including replacing test IDs, implementing GDPR compliance, and adding reward ad functionality. These are critical for monetization and legal compliance.

### 1.3 Firebase UI Integration Gap
- **Impact**: Firebase backend services exist but are not fully integrated into the app's UI, limiting user access to key features.
- **Details**: UI placeholders exist without real functionality, and some integrations (like Facebook SAM and multi-object detection) are incomplete.

### 1.4 Performance - Offline Mode Hang
- **Impact**: Enabling offline mode causes the app to freeze for over 16 seconds, severely affecting user experience.
- **Details**: The app needs background downloading with a progress indicator to resolve this issue.

## 2. High and Medium Priority Issues

### 2.1 Location Services Missing
- **Impact**: The app cannot provide location-based disposal facilities due to missing GPS permissions, hardcoded distance calculations, and lack of maps integration.
- **Details**: There is no geolocator dependency, and maps integration is only marked as a TODO.

### 2.2 Firebase Security Rules
- **Impact**: Data in Firestore is not properly secured, risking user privacy and data integrity.
- **Details**: Comprehensive security rules, user data access control, and family data isolation are needed.

### 2.3 Platform-Specific UI Missing
- **Impact**: The app uses the same Material Design for both iOS and Android, missing native UI elements and platform detection.
- **Details**: This affects user experience and platform consistency.

### 2.4 Visual Style Guide Violations
- **Impact**: Inconsistent use of colors and styling across the app.
- **Details**: Some categories do not follow the visual style guide, and button colors are inconsistent.

### 2.5 Memory Management
- **Impact**: Potential memory leaks and performance issues with large data sets and image caching.
- **Details**: No lazy loading for analytics and unoptimized image caching.

## 3. Low Priority and Minor Issues

### 3.1 Dark Mode Support
- **Impact**: The app does not support dark mode, affecting accessibility and user preference.

### 3.2 App Logo Missing
- **Impact**: The app uses the default Flutter logo instead of a custom logo, reducing brand identity.

### 3.3 Loading States Minimal
- **Impact**: Minimal loading indicators lead to poor perceived performance.

### 3.4 Chart Accessibility
- **Impact**: Charts are not readable by screen readers, affecting accessibility for visually impaired users.

### 3.5 Documentation Gaps
- **Impact**: Missing or incomplete API documentation and user guides hinder onboarding and maintenance.

### 4.7 Storage Service
- **Details**: TODOs for Firebase migration, data sync, and conflict resolution.

### 4.8 Gamification Service
- **Details**: TODOs for social features, leaderboard, and advanced challenges.

### 4.9 UI Screens and Widgets

## 5. QA and Best Practice Issues

### 5.1 Debug Artifacts in Production
- **Impact**: Debug toasts, error messages, and print statements should not be present in production builds.

### 5.2 Layout and Overflow Issues
