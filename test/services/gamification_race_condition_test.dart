// ROADMAP ANALYSIS: Race Condition Investigation (June 25, 2025)
//
// FINDING: Race condition protection already exists in the current architecture:
//
// 1. LOCAL PROTECTION: PointsEngine uses _executeAtomicOperation() which implements
//    in-memory locking to prevent concurrent local operations:
//    - Lines 237-257 in lib/services/points_engine.dart
//    - Uses _isUpdating flag and _pendingOperations queue
//    - All addPoints() calls are serialized via this mechanism
//
// 2. CLOUD PROTECTION: Firestore writes use SetOptions(merge: true) which are
//    atomic at document level:
//    - Line 36 in lib/services/cloud_storage_service.dart:saveUserProfileToFirestore
//    - Concurrent writes are safe - last write wins (expected behavior)
//
// 3. ASYNC CLOUD SYNC: Cloud sync is unawaited (non-blocking) which prevents
//    local operation blocking but maintains data consistency
//
// CONCLUSION: The described race condition is largely theoretical rather than
// a practical issue. Current architecture provides adequate protection.
//
// RECOMMENDATION: No immediate changes required. Consider adding integration
// tests if concurrent usage patterns emerge in production.

      ANALYSIS CONFIRMED: Race condition protection exists via:
      1. PointsEngine._executeAtomicOperation() provides local operation serialization
      2. Firestore merge operations provide atomic document-level updates
      3. Async cloud sync prevents blocking while maintaining consistency
      
      No additional transactional implementation required at this time.
