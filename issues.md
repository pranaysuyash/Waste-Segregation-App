## 1. Developer Options — Deep Dive

**Purpose & Strengths:**
*   Feature Toggling: Instant switching for premium features (ads, analytics, offline, themes, navigation styles) speeds up dev and QA.
*   State Simulation: Test theme, ad, and premium state handling quickly.
*   Destructive Testing: Crash reporting ("Force Crash") and data reset ("Factory Reset") options validate critical app infrastructure and error reporting.
*   Rapid Iteration: Enables agile feature development and troubleshooting.

**Key Issues & Risks:**
*   ✅ **BLOCKER: Factory Reset Type Cast Error** - RESOLVED
    *   **Original Bug:** `'_Map<String, dynamic>' is not a subtype of type 'Map<String, String>?'`
    *   **Root Cause (Confirmed):** Unsafe type casting during SharedPreferences/local storage clearing or re-initialization.
    *   **Resolution:** Robust type checks and safe defaults implemented.
*   ✅ **Build Safety** - RESOLVED
    *   **Requirement Met:** DeveloperConfig with compile-time and runtime safety checks ensures exclusion from production builds.
*   📋 **Code Hygiene**
    *   **Action:** Conduct a global code review for similar unsafe type casts, especially around serialization/deserialization of local/synced data, settings upgrades, and user state resets.
*   📋 **Access Controls (Dev Builds)**
    *   **Consideration:** For internal builds, consider hiding Developer Options behind a non-obvious gesture (e.g., multiple taps on app version in "About").

**Recommendations:**
*   ✅ **Factory Reset Bug**: FIXED (Robust type checks and safe defaults implemented)
*   ✅ **Dev Tools in Release**: FIXED (Build flags enforce stripping from release builds)
*   📋 **Internal Documentation**: Document the effect and intended state of each toggle for ongoing maintenance and QA
*   📋 **Destructive Test Recovery**: Add tests for app recovery from incomplete/corrupt data states
