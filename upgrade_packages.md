# Package Upgrade Plan

Based on the `flutter pub outdated` analysis, here's a plan to update your dependencies:

## Direct Dependencies to Upgrade

### High Priority
- **provider**: 6.1.2 → 6.1.5
  - Simple update, low risk

### Medium Priority
- **camera**: 0.10.6 → 0.11.1 
  - Major version update, requires testing camera functionality
  - May require code changes

- **google_sign_in**: 6.2.2 → 6.3.0
  - Minor version update, should be backward compatible
  - Test authentication flow after update

- **share_plus**: 10.1.4 → 11.0.0
  - Major version update
  - Check for API changes in sharing functionality

### Low Priority
- **googleapis**: 13.2.0 → 14.0.0
  - Major version update
  - May require API usage updates
  - Test Google Drive sync functionality after update

## Dev Dependencies to Upgrade

- **build_runner**: 2.4.13 → 2.4.15
  - Minor version update, low risk

- **flutter_lints**: 3.0.2 → 5.0.0
  - Major version update
  - May introduce new lint rules requiring code changes

- **json_serializable**: 6.9.0 → 6.9.5
  - Patch update, low risk

## Upgrade Command

To upgrade the direct dependencies with minimal risk:

```bash
flutter pub upgrade provider
```

For a full upgrade of all dependencies (after testing):

```bash
flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
```

## Testing Plan

After upgrading:

1. Test camera functionality on both Android and iOS
2. Verify Google Sign-In works correctly
3. Check that sharing features function as expected
4. Validate Google Drive sync operations
5. Run the app on web platform to ensure cross-platform compatibility
6. Run `flutter analyze` to check for any new lint issues

## Potential Issues

- Camera package upgrade may require changes to camera initialization or usage code
- Major version upgrades might introduce breaking changes requiring code modifications
- New lint rules might require code style changes

## Recommended Approach

1. Start by upgrading provider (safest)
2. Next upgrade dev dependencies
3. Then upgrade packages with minor version bumps
4. Finally address the major version upgrades one at a time, with testing between each

This phased approach minimizes risk and makes it easier to identify which update might cause issues.
