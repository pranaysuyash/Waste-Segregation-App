# Package Upgrade Plan

Based on the `flutter pub outdated` analysis, here's a plan to update your dependencies:

## Upgrade Progress

### Phase 1: Completed ✅
- **provider**: 6.1.2 → 6.1.5 ✅
  - Successfully upgraded

### Phase 2: Completed ✅
- Using `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions` to upgrade multiple packages at once:
  - **camera**: 0.10.6 → 0.11.0+2 ✅
  - **flutter_lints**: 3.0.2 → 5.0.0 ✅
  - **share_plus**: 10.1.4 → 11.0.0 ✅
  - **google_sign_in_ios**: 5.8.1 → 5.9.0 ✅
  - **google_identity_services_web**: 0.3.3 → 0.3.3+1 ✅
  - **lints**: 3.0.0 → 5.0.0 ✅

### Remaining Dependencies to Upgrade
- **google_sign_in**: 6.2.2 → 6.3.0
- **googleapis**: 13.2.0 → 14.0.0
- **build_runner**: 2.4.13 → 2.4.15
- **json_serializable**: 6.9.0 → 6.9.5

## Build Verification

- Web build successful ✅
  - Note: Requires `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag due to non-constant IconData instances
  - Command: `flutter build web --web-renderer canvaskit --no-tree-shake-icons`
- Android build started but timed out in the CI environment (expected behavior)

## Testing Status

1. ⏳ Test camera functionality on both Android and iOS
2. ⏳ Verify Google Sign-In works correctly
3. ⏳ Check that sharing features function as expected
4. ⏳ Validate Google Drive sync operations
5. ✅ Web build completes successfully (with `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag)
6. ✅ `flutter analyze` reveals several issues that need to be addressed

## Potential Issues Found

### Web Build Issues
- Web build requires `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag due to non-constant IconData instances in:
  - lib/widgets/gamification_widgets.dart
  - lib/screens/achievements_screen.dart
- This issue should be fixed by making IconData instances constants

### Package Deprecation Issues
- ✅ Fixed: The Share class used in result_screen.dart is now updated:
  - Line 59: Replaced `Share.share` with `SharePlus.instance.share()`
  - Line 79: Replaced `Share.shareXFiles` with `SharePlus.instance.share()` with files parameter
  - Changes committed to work with share_plus package version 11.0.0

### Test File Issues
- test/widget_test.dart has several issues with constructor arguments:
  - GoogleDriveService constructor parameters have changed
  - The test file needs to be updated to match the current application structure

### Other Issues 
- Several instances of `print` statements in production code should be replaced with proper logging
- Several BuildContext usage across async gaps that might lead to memory leaks

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Update SharePlus API usage to be compatible with v11.0.0
2. Fix the non-constant IconData instances issue in:
   - lib/widgets/gamification_widgets.dart
   - lib/screens/achievements_screen.dart
3. Update test files to match the current application structure
4. Fix BuildContext usage across async gaps
5. Replace print statements with proper logging
6. Complete upgrading remaining dependencies
7. Run full regression testing across all platforms

## Upgrade Commands Used

```bash
# Phase 1
flutter pub upgrade provider

# Phase 2
flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
