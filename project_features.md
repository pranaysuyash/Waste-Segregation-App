## Implementation Priority Plan

### High Priority (Next Sprint)
1. Cross-user classification caching with Firestore: share hashed classification results across users/devices to cut AI API usage and improve response times
2. UI Refactoring & Modularization: break down HomeScreen, AchievementsScreen, QuizScreen, and ResultScreen into reusable widget components for better maintainability
3. Settings Screen Implementation: complete UI for theme (light/dark), language selection, and notification preferences
4. Quiz System Completion: finalize quiz UI, scoring logic, and feedback screens
5. Leaderboard Feature: build leaderboard UI and backend integration for community challenges
6. Data Export/Import Flows: add export to CSV/JSON and import functionality in settings/history
7. Educational Content Filtering & Search: advanced category, difficulty, and keyword filters in educational screens
8. Offline Classification Support: enable on-device classification fallback or local caching when network is unavailable
9. Social Sharing & Feedback: allow users to share classification results and submit feedback/corrections to improve AI accuracy
10. Localization & Internationalization: integrate Flutter localization for multi-language support and RTL layout

### Medium Priority
1. Implement theme customization
2. Add social sharing capabilities
3. Enhance educational content filtering
4. Implement bookmark/favorites system
5. Add user analytics dashboard
6. Improve error handling and recovery

### Low Priority
1. Implement multi-language support
2. Add team/friend challenge system
3. Implement interactive onboarding tutorials
4. Add voice guidance support
5. Develop mini-games for waste sorting

## Technical Notes

- The AI classification uses Google's Gemini API via an OpenAI-compatible endpoint with the gemini-2.0-flash model
- Authentication uses Google Sign-In with standard OAuth flow
- Local storage is handled through Hive database with encryption
- The app is built using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility
- Firebase integration is planned but not yet implemented
