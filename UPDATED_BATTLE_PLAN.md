# üöÄ Updated Battle Plan: Path to 100% Completion & Beyond

**Current Status**: 90% Complete  
**Time to 100%**: <30 minutes after billing upgrade  
**Last Updated**: June 16, 2025

---

## üéØ **Phase 1: Final 10% - Immediate Completion (Next 30 minutes)**

### **Critical Action Required: Firebase Billing Upgrade**

| What | Why it matters | Concrete next step |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Upgrade Firebase to Blaze Plan** | Cloud Functions require paid plan for deployment. All code is ready, just needs billing. | 1) Navigate to Firebase Console<br>2) Click "Upgrade to Blaze Plan"<br>3) Complete billing setup |
| **Deploy Cloud Functions** | AI disposal instructions and health checks are coded but not deployed | `cd functions && npm run build && firebase deploy --only functions` |
| **Verify Deployment** | Ensure all endpoints are working correctly | Test health check and disposal generation endpoints |

> **Why first?** ‚Äì This single action moves the project from 90% to 100% complete.
