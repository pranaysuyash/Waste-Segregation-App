## Usage Instructions

### Local Development

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/run_all_tests.sh

# Run specific test types
flutter test test/                    # Unit + Widget tests
flutter test test/golden/             # Golden tests only
flutter test integration_test/        # Integration tests
patrol test                          # E2E tests

# Run Widgetbook
flutter run -t widgetbook/main.dart -d chrome
```

### CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
1. Runs all test types on every PR
2. Detects visual regressions
3. Uploads screenshots to Percy
4. Generates coverage reports
