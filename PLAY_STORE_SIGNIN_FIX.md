- [ ] Select "Waste Segregation" app
- [ ] Navigate to **Release** → **Setup** → **App signing**
- [ ] Copy the **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint** under "App signing key certificate"

- [ ] Upload to Play Console for internal testing
- [ ] Test Google Sign-In functionality

## 🚨 Why This Happens

When you upload to Play Store:
1. **Local testing**: Uses your debug/upload certificate ✅
2. **Play Store**: Google re-signs with Play App Signing certificate ❌
3. **Firebase**: Only knows about your certificates, not Play Store's
4. **Result**: Google Sign-In fails with error code 10

## 🎯 Expected Result

After fixing:
- ✅ Google Sign-In works in Play Store internal testing
- ✅ No more `PlatformException` errors
- ✅ Users can sign in and sync data
