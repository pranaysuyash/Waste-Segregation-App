# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Flutter application for AI-powered waste classification and environmental education. The app uses multiple AI models (primarily OpenAI GPT, with Gemini fallback) to identify items and classify them into waste categories: Wet Waste, Dry Waste, Hazardous Waste, Medical Waste, and Non-Waste.

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate model code (required for Hive serialization)
flutter pub run build_runner build

# Run the app with environment variables
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env

# Validated run with error checking (recommended)
./scripts/development/run_with_env.sh

# Run linting
flutter analyze

# Run tests
flutter test

# Update golden test files
flutter test --update-goldens
```

### Build Commands

flutter build ios --release --dart-define-from-file=.env
```

### Testing Commands
```bash

flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter pub run build_runner build

# Fix common Dart/Flutter issues
dart fix --apply
```

## Architecture Overview

### State Management
- **Primary**: Provider pattern for most state management
- **Secondary**: Riverpod for specific providers (app_providers.dart)
- **Local Storage**: Hive for offline data persistence
- **Cloud Sync**: Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization

### Core Services Architecture

#### AI Classification System
- **AIService** (`lib/services/ai_service.dart`): Multi-tier AI system with OpenAI (primary) and Gemini (fallback)
- **CacheService**: SHA-256 based image classification caching
- **ResultPipeline**: Processes classification results and handles saving

#### Storage Architecture
- **StorageService**: Hive-based local storage for classifications, user profiles, gamification data
- **EnhancedStorageService**: Extended storage with thumbnail generation and migration support
- **CloudStorageService**: Firebase Firestore integration for real-time sync
- **GoogleDriveService**: Optional full backup/restore via Google Drive

#### Gamification System
- **GamificationService**: Points, achievements, challenges, and streak tracking
- **PointsEngine**: Core points calculation and distribution logic
- **PointsEngineProvider**: Provider wrapper for points management

#### Content and Community
- **EducationalContentService**: Manages articles, videos, quizzes about waste segregation
- **CommunityService**: Handles shared classifications and community features
- **DisposalInstructionsService**: Provides disposal guidance for classified items

### Key Models and Data Structure

#### Core Models (`lib/models/`)
- **WasteClassification**: Primary data model for AI classification results
- **UserProfile**: User settings, preferences, and gamification progress
- **Gamification**: Points, achievements, streaks, and challenge data
- **EducationalContent**: Articles, videos, and quizzes
- **CachedClassification**: Local caching for repeated image analysis

#### Generated Models
All models ending in `.g.dart` are auto-generated by `build_runner` for Hive serialization and JSON handling.

### Screen Architecture

#### Navigation Structure
- **MainNavigationWrapper**: Bottom navigation with Home, History, Settings
- **GlobalMenuWrapper**: Consistent app bar and navigation across screens
- **NavigationSettingsService**: Manages navigation preferences and behavior

#### Core Screens (`lib/screens/`)
- **AuthScreen**: Google Sign-in and guest mode
- **HomeScreen/ModernHomeScreen**: Main classification interface with camera/gallery
- **ResultScreen**: Shows AI classification results with disposal instructions
- **HistoryScreen**: Past classifications with filtering and search
- **AchievementsScreen**: Gamification progress and badges
- **SettingsScreen**: App preferences and account management

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables (.env file)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_MODEL_PRIMARY=gpt-4.1-nano
OPENAI_API_MODEL_SECONDARY=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_API_MODEL_TERTIARY=gpt-4.1-mini
GEMINI_API_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
```

### Firebase Configuration
- Requires `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)
- Enable Firestore, Authentication, Crashlytics, Performance, and Storage
- Firestore indexes are defined in `firestore.indexes.json`

### Development Dependencies
- Flutter SDK 3.5.0+
- Dart SDK 3.5.0+
- Android Studio/Xcode for mobile development
- Node.js for Storybook testing framework

## Important Implementation Notes

### AI Service Integration
The app uses a 4-tier fallback system for AI classification:
1. OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano (primary)
2. OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (secondary) 
3. OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini (tertiary)
4. Google Gemini 2.0-flash (final fallback)

### State Management Patterns
- Use Provider for most UI state and service management
- Use Riverpod providers in `app_providers.dart` for dependency injection
- Services are injected through MultiProvider in main.dart
- Local state uses Hive for persistence, cloud state syncs via Firestore

### Image Handling
- Uses `image_picker` for camera/gallery access
- Generates thumbnails via `enhanced_storage_service.dart`
- Implements SHA-256 based caching to avoid re-analyzing identical images
- Supports both local storage and optional cloud backup

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for models and services in `test/` directory
- Widget tests with golden file testing for UI consistency
- Patrol framework for E2E testing (integration_test_disabled/ when needed)
- Comprehensive UI overflow and accessibility testing

### Code Quality and Linting
- Strict linting rules defined in `analysis_options.yaml`
- Emphasis on const constructors, final variables, and performance optimization
- Print statements should use `WasteAppLogger` instead of `print()` or `debugPrint()`
- Follow Flutter best practices for state management and widget composition

- Implement lazy loading for large lists (history, educational content)
- Cache frequently accessed data with appropriate invalidation strategies
- Monitor memory usage, especially for image handling and storage services
