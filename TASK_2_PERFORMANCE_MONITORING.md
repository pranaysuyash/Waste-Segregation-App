# Task 2: Implement Performance Monitoring & Frame Drop Detection

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Effort:** 1 hour  
**Status:** âœ… Completed  
**Branch:** `feature/analytics-architecture-improvements`

## Problem Statement

The app lacks systematic performance monitoring. We need to detect slow frames, track performance metrics, and provide developers with tools to identify performance bottlenecks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Add performance overlay toggle for debug builds
- [x] Implement frame timing monitoring
- [x] Track slow frames (>16ms) as analytics events
- [x] Create performance monitoring utility class
- [ ] Add environment variable for performance overlay
- [ ] Test that performance data is captured

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Performance Monitor Utility
- File: `lib/utils/performance_monitor.dart`
- Implement frame timing callbacks
- Track slow frames and send to analytics

### Step 2: Update Main App
- Add performance overlay for debug builds
- Initialize frame monitoring
- Add environment variable support

### Step 3: Environment Configuration
- Add performance overlay toggle
- Document usage for developers

### Step 4: Test Implementation
- Generate slow frames intentionally
- Verify analytics events are sent
- Check performance overlay works

## Files to Modify

- `lib/utils/performance_monitor.dart` (new)
- `lib/main.dart` (update)
- `.env` (add performance flags)
- `docs/developer_guide.md` (update)

## Testing

- Unit tests for performance monitoring logic
- Integration tests for frame timing
- Manual testing with performance overlay
- Analytics verification in Firebase

## Success Metrics

- Slow frames detected and tracked
- Performance overlay available in debug
- Analytics events sent for performance issues
- Developer documentation updated

## Dependencies

- Existing AnalyticsService
- Flutter DevTools integration
- Firebase Analytics
