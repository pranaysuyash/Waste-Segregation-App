## 🔍 Analysis

### Possible Root Causes
1. **Test Infrastructure Issues**: All tests timing out suggests infrastructure problems
2. **Dependency Issues**: Missing or incompatible test dependencies
3. **Environment Setup**: Test environment may not be properly configured
4. **Mock Service Issues**: Service mocks may be failing to initialize
5. **Async/Await Issues**: Potential deadlocks in async test operations

### Previous Working State
- **170+ tests** were previously passing
- Recent changes may have introduced breaking changes
- Test infrastructure was working before recent updates

---

## 🎯 Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Diagnosis (Day 1)
1. **Check test dependencies** in `pubspec.yaml`
2. **Verify test environment setup**
3. **Run individual test files** to isolate issues
4. **Check for missing test data/fixtures**
5. **Verify mock service configurations**

### Phase 2: Service-by-Service Fix (Days 2-3)
1. **Start with simplest tests** (model tests)
2. **Fix service mock issues** one by one
3. **Resolve async/timeout issues**
4. **Update test configurations** as needed

### Phase 3: Integration & Coverage (Days 4-5)
1. **Fix integration test workflows**
2. **Restore code coverage reporting**
3. **Add missing accessibility tests**
4. **Verify golden test updates**

## 🚨 Release Impact

### Release Blocker Status
🔴 **CANNOT RELEASE** with current test status

### Requirements for Release
1. **Minimum 80% test success rate**
2. **All critical service tests passing**
3. **Integration tests working**
4. **Code coverage > 70%**
5. **No security test failures**

## 📈 Recovery Metrics

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests: >90% passing
- [ ] Widget tests: >85% passing  
- [ ] Integration tests: 100% passing
- [ ] Performance tests: 100% passing
- [ ] Security tests: 100% passing
- [ ] Code coverage: >70%
- [ ] Test execution time: <60 seconds

### Monitoring
- Daily test runs until recovery
- Track success rate improvements
- Monitor test execution time
- Verify coverage reporting

## 📞 Escalation

### If Issues Persist After 3 Days
1. **Review recent code changes** that may have broken tests
2. **Consider reverting** to last known working state
3. **Rebuild test infrastructure** from scratch if needed
4. **Seek external review** of test configuration
