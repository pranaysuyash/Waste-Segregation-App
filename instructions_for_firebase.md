# Firebase Configuration Status

✅ **Firebase Integration Complete**: The Firebase SDK has been successfully integrated into your project, and Google Sign-In is now working properly.

## Implemented Changes

1. **Firebase SDK Integration**:
   - Added Google services plugin to the project-level build.gradle
   - Applied the Google services plugin to the app-level build.gradle
   - Added Firebase dependencies with a compatible version
   - Updated minSdk to 23 as required by Firebase Auth

2. **SHA Certificate Fingerprints Added**:
   - Successfully registered the SHA-1 fingerprint with Firebase
   - Authentication is now properly working

3. **Google Sign-In Configuration**:
   - Google Sign-In has been enabled in Firebase Authentication
   - The updated google-services.json file has been integrated
   - Authentication flow has been successfully tested

## Future Configuration (If Needed)

If you need to add new devices or release builds, you'll need to add their certificate fingerprints:

1. For new debug devices, generate the fingerprint using:
   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -storepass android -keypass android | grep SHA
   ```

2. For release builds, generate the fingerprint from your release keystore:
   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore your-release-key.keystore | grep SHA
   ```

3. Add the new fingerprints to Firebase:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → Project settings
   - In the Android app section, add the new fingerprints

## Authentication Troubleshooting

If authentication issues occur in the future:

1. Verify the SHA fingerprint is correctly added to Firebase
2. Ensure Google Sign-in is enabled in Firebase Authentication
3. Check that the latest google-services.json file is in the project
4. Verify internet connectivity and Google Play Services on the device

## Technical Implementation Details

The Firebase SDK is integrated with these specific configurations:

1. **Gradle Configuration**:
   - Project-level build.gradle: Added Google services plugin 4.4.2
   - App-level build.gradle: Applied Google services plugin
   - Firebase BoM version: 32.7.2 (specifically chosen for Kotlin 1.8.22 compatibility)
   - Added Firebase Analytics and Auth dependencies

2. **Android Configuration**:
   - minSdk version: 23 (updated to support Firebase Auth)
   - google-services.json: Updated with the SHA-1 fingerprint

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Fixed RenderFlex overflow in classification_card.dart
   - Added enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true" to AndroidManifest.xml for silencing Android 14 back button warnings

These changes collectively enable Google Sign-In functionality while maintaining compatibility with the existing project structure.
