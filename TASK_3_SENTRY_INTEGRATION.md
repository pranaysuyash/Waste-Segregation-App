# Task 3: Add Sentry Integration for Enhanced Error Tracking

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Effort:** 1.5 hours  
**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Branch:** `feature/analytics-architecture-improvements`

## Problem Statement

Currently, error tracking relies only on Firebase Crashlytics. The blueprint recommends adding Sentry for enhanced error correlation, performance monitoring, and better debugging capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add sentry_flutter dependency
- [ ] Configure Sentry DSN and settings
- [ ] Integrate with existing error handling
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring (tracesSampleRate)
- [ ] Add breadcrumbs for better debugging
- [ ] Test error reporting works
- [ ] Maintain Firebase Crashlytics alongside Sentry

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Add Dependencies
- Add `sentry_flutter` to pubspec.yaml
- Configure Sentry DSN in environment variables

### Step 2: Initialize Sentry
- Initialize Sentry in main.dart
- Configure sampling rates and options
- Set up user context and tags

### Step 3: Update Error Handling
- Integrate Sentry with existing error handlers
- Add breadcrumbs for user actions
- Capture performance transactions

### Step 4: Test Integration
- Generate test errors
- Verify Sentry dashboard receives data
- Check performance traces

## Files to Modify

- `pubspec.yaml` (add dependency)
- `lib/main.dart` (initialize Sentry)
- `lib/utils/error_handler.dart` (integrate Sentry)
- `.env` (add Sentry DSN)
- `lib/services/analytics_service.dart` (add breadcrumbs)

## Testing

- Unit tests for Sentry integration
- Error reporting verification
- Performance monitoring tests
- Manual testing with Sentry dashboard

## Success Metrics

- Errors reported to both Firebase and Sentry
- Performance traces captured
- Breadcrumbs provide useful debugging context
- No impact on app performance

## Dependencies

- Existing Firebase Crashlytics
- Error handling infrastructure
- Analytics service for breadcrumbs

## Notes

- Start with tracesSampleRate = 0.2 (20%)
- Use Sentry's privacy controls for PII
- Maintain dual reporting for redundancy
