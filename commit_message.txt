feat: Complete Phase 2 batch processing system with enhanced monitoring

This commit implements a comprehensive AI batch processing and cost optimization system
following the notepad roadmap Phase 1-2, including enhanced queue monitoring and UX.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Features Implemented

### Enhanced AI Job Models
- Added missing fields to QueueStats: pendingJobs, averageProcessingTime, estimatedWaitTime, successRate, failureRate
- Enhanced AiJob model with queuePosition and estimatedCompletion for better UX
- Added comprehensive helper methods for status descriptions and time estimates
- Implemented proper JSON serialization with backward compatibility

### Complete Batch Job Service (AiJobService)
- Fixed model alignment issues and removed non-existent field references
- Implemented proper CloudStorageService integration for image uploads
- Added system prompt and OpenAI API key configuration methods
- Enhanced queue statistics calculation with processing time metrics
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging throughout

### Job Queue UI (JobQueueScreen)
- Created modern, responsive job queue interface with Material 3 design
- Separated active vs completed jobs with distinct visual treatment
- Real-time status indicators with progress bars and queue position
- Comprehensive error states and empty state handling
- Pull-to-refresh functionality for live updates

### Enhanced Monitoring & Analytics
- Queue health indicators (healthy/moderate/busy/overloaded)
- Success/failure rate tracking with percentage displays
- Average processing time calculation from historical data
- Estimated wait times based on queue length and processing speed
- User-friendly time formatting (minutes/hours/days)

### Cloud Storage Integration
- Added uploadImageForBatchProcessing method to CloudStorageService
- Proper EnhancedImageService integration for permanent image storage
- Production-ready TODO for Firebase Storage upload with public URLs
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Riverpod Integration
- Fixed missing aiServiceProvider in app_providers.dart
- Updated all batch job providers to use correct method signatures
- Removed invalid parameters from job creation calls
- Clean separation of concerns between UI and business logic

### Model Consistency
- Fixed AiJobStatus enum usage (replaced 'pending' with 'queued')
- Aligned all field references with actual model definitions
- Added proper factory constructors and copyWith methods
- Enhanced toString methods for better debugging

### Error Resolution
- Resolved all critical linter errors and build issues
- Fixed CloudStorageService constructor and method calls
- Added missing imports and extensions (AnalysisSpeedExtension)
- Proper error handling with fallback states

## ðŸ“Š Queue Monitoring Features

### Real-time Statistics
- Total jobs processed today
- Current queue length and processing jobs
- Average wait time and processing time
- Success/failure rates with historical data

### User Experience Enhancements
- Queue position display for waiting jobs
- Estimated completion times
- Visual progress indicators
- Status-specific icons and colors
- Comprehensive error messages

### Admin/Monitoring Capabilities
- Queue health assessment (healthy â†’ overloaded)
- Processing performance metrics
- Historical data analysis
- System load indicators

## ðŸš€ Production Readiness

### Configuration
- Environment-based OpenAI API key configuration
- Proper error handling for missing configuration
- Comprehensive logging throughout the system
- Production TODOs documented for Firebase Storage

### Scalability
- Efficient Firestore queries with proper indexing
- Batch operations for queue statistics
- LRU cache maintenance for optimal performance
- Memory-efficient image handling

### Security
- Proper user authentication checks
- Secure token deduction before job creation
- Error message sanitization
- Input validation throughout

## ðŸ“± User Interface

### Modern Design
- Material 3 design language
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Accessible color schemes and icons

### Interactive Elements
- Pull-to-refresh for real-time updates
- Loading states and error handling
- Empty state with clear call-to-action
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Information Architecture
- Clear separation of active vs completed jobs
- Hierarchical information display
- Contextual actions and navigation
- Progressive disclosure of details

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps (Phase 3)

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Cloud Function batch processor deployment
- Firebase Storage integration for public image URLs
- Advanced queue management and priority handling
- Real-time notifications for job completion
- Analytics dashboard for system monitoring

## ðŸ“ˆ Impact

- **Cost Optimization**: 50% discount on batch processing via OpenAI Batch API
- **User Experience**: Clear queue visibility and realistic time estimates
- **System Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics for performance optimization
- **Scalability**: Foundation for handling thousands of concurrent jobs
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns

All critical errors resolved. System ready for Phase 3 implementation.
