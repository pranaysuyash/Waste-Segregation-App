## üéØ **DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES**

### **Adding New Scripts**
1. **Choose appropriate category** based on script purpose
2. **Use descriptive names** that clearly indicate functionality
3. **Add to this index** with proper description
4. **Include usage examples** in script comments
5. **Test thoroughly** before committing

### **Script Best Practices**
- **Error handling**: Include proper error checking and messages
- **Documentation**: Add comments explaining complex operations
- **Validation**: Check prerequisites and environment setup
- **Logging**: Provide clear output for debugging
- **Exit codes**: Use proper exit codes for automation

### **Maintenance**
- **Regular review**: Check scripts monthly for updates needed
- **Testing**: Verify scripts work with latest Flutter/environment changes
- **Documentation**: Keep this index updated with new scripts
- **Cleanup**: Remove obsolete or unused scripts
