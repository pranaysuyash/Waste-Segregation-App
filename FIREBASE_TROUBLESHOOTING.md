# Firebase and Google Sign-In Setup Troubleshooting

## Issue

You're experiencing a CocoaPods error related to GoogleUtilities dependency:

```
[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "GoogleUtilities/Environment":
  In Podfile:
    firebase_core (from `.symlinks/plugins/firebase_core/ios`) was resolved to 2.32.0, which depends on
      Firebase/CoreOnly (= 10.25.0) was resolved to 10.25.0, which depends on
        FirebaseCore (= 10.25.0) was resolved to 10.25.0, which depends on
          GoogleUtilities/Environment (~> 7.12)
```

## Solution

I've made the following changes to fix this issue:

1. **Updated Podfile**:
   - Added official CocoaPods source repositories
   - Removed explicit GoogleUtilities version declaration to allow proper dependency resolution

2. **Created `fix_pods.sh` script**:
   - This script will clean the Flutter project
   - Update dependencies
   - Reset the CocoaPods cache
   - Update the CocoaPods repository
   - Reinstall all pods with verbose output

## Steps to Fix

1. **Make the script executable and run it**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x fix_pods.sh
   ./fix_pods.sh
   ```

2. **If the script fails**, try these steps manually:
   ```bash
   # Update CocoaPods itself
   sudo gem install cocoapods

   # Clean Flutter project and get dependencies
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get

   # Update CocoaPods repos
   cd ios
   rm -rf Pods
   rm -f Podfile.lock
   pod repo update
   pod install --repo-update
   ```

3. **If still having issues**:
   - Try using a more recent version of CocoaPods
   - Check if your Ruby version is compatible with CocoaPods
   - Make sure your Mac has the latest Xcode command line tools

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

Remember that we've also updated your pubspec.yaml to use compatible versions of dependencies:
- Downgraded share_plus to ^10.0.0
- Downgraded firebase_auth to ^4.16.0

## If All Else Fails

As a last resort, you can temporarily comment out Firebase-related code to get the app running without Google Sign-In:

1. Comment out Firebase initialization in AppDelegate.swift
2. Comment out Firebase initialization in main.dart
3. Modify your GoogleDriveService to skip actual Google Sign-In for testing

This would allow you to test other parts of the app while resolving the Firebase integration issues.
