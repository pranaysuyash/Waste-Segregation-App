          ❌ **Golden tests failed** - Visual changes detected that may be regressions.
          
          ### What this means:
          - UI components have visual differences from the approved "golden" images
          - This could be intentional changes or unintended regressions
          
          ### Next steps:
          1. **Review the changes**: Check if the visual changes are intentional
          2. **If intentional**: Update golden files with \`flutter test --update-goldens\`
          3. **If regression**: Fix the UI issues
          4. **Re-run tests**: Push your changes to re-trigger this check
          
          ### Download artifacts:
          - Check the "golden-test-failures" artifact for detailed diff images
          
          > 🤖 **AI Agent Note**: If you made intentional UI changes, you may need to update the golden files.`;
