# Contributing to Waste Segregation App

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our AI-powered waste segregation application! This guide will help you get started with our sophisticated development workflow.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repository and clone your fork
2. **Environment Setup**: Follow the [README.md](../README.md) setup instructions
3. **Branch Strategy**: Create feature branches from `develop` 
4. **Testing**: Our advanced CI pipeline will validate your changes

## üèóÔ∏è Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code with releases
- `develop` - Integration branch for new features
- `feature/*` - New features and enhancements
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes and patches
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

### Commit Guidelines
Follow conventional commits format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples**:
```
feat(classification): add new AI model for plastic detection
fix(ui): resolve achievement celebration animation timing
docs(contributing): update golden test procedures
test(integration): add waste classification accuracy tests
```

## üß™ Testing Framework

We have a sophisticated testing infrastructure that you must understand:

### 1. Unit Tests
```bash
flutter test --coverage --exclude-tags=golden
```

### 2. Golden Tests (Visual Regression)
Our **advanced visual regression testing** automatically detects UI changes:

```bash
# Run golden tests
flutter test test/golden/

# Update golden files (only if changes are intentional)
./scripts/testing/golden_test_manager.sh update
```

**Important**: Golden test failures will block PRs until resolved!

### 3. Integration Tests
```bash
flutter test integration_test/
```

### 4. AI Classification Tests
Test the AI models with various waste types:
```bash
flutter test test/ai/ --tags=ai-classification
```

## üé® UI/UX Guidelines

### Design System
- Follow Material Design 3 principles
- Use the established color palette and typography
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Test in both light and dark modes

### Visual Regression Protocol
1. **Before making UI changes**: Run golden tests to establish baseline
2. **After changes**: Golden tests will automatically detect differences
3. **If intentional**: Update golden files using the script
4. **If unintentional**: Fix the regression before continuing

### Animation Standards
- Use standardized durations from `lib/utils/animation_constants.dart`
- Test animations on both high-end and low-end devices
- Ensure animations respect accessibility preferences

## ü§ñ AI & Machine Learning

### Classification System
- Test with diverse waste samples
- Validate accuracy across different lighting conditions
- Ensure consistent performance across devices

### Model Updates
- Document any AI model changes thoroughly
- Include accuracy metrics and validation results
- Test backward compatibility

## üìù Documentation

### Required Documentation
- Update relevant files in `/docs/` directory
- Follow the [Documentation Index](docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) structure
- Include code examples for new features

### Documentation Categories
- **Status documents** ‚Üí `/docs/status/`
- **Technical guides** ‚Üí `/docs/technical/`
- **Feature docs** ‚Üí `/docs/features/`
- **Fix summaries** ‚Üí `/docs/fixes/`

## üîç Code Review Process

### Before Submitting PR
1. ‚úÖ Run all tests locally: `flutter test`
2. ‚úÖ Check formatting: `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .`
3. ‚úÖ Run static analysis: `flutter analyze --fatal-infos`
4. ‚úÖ Update documentation if needed
5. ‚úÖ Test on physical device

### PR Requirements
- [ ] All CI checks pass (build, test, golden tests, code quality)
- [ ] No visual regressions (unless intentional and documented)
- [ ] Documentation updated for new features
- [ ] Tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Breaking changes documented in PR description

### PR Review Criteria
- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Performance**: No performance regressions
- **UI/UX**: Consistent with design system
- **Testing**: Adequate test coverage
- **Documentation**: Clear and complete

## üèÜ Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Maintain >85% test coverage
- Follow Dart/Flutter style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Performance
- Profile performance-critical code
- Optimize for low-end devices
- Monitor memory usage and battery impact

### Accessibility
- Test with screen readers
- Ensure proper color contrast
- Support keyboard navigation where applicable

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Golden Test Failures
```bash
# If you see "Golden tests failed - Visual regressions detected!"
# 1. Check if changes are intentional
# 2. If yes, update golden files:
./scripts/testing/golden_test_manager.sh update

# 3. If no, investigate the visual differences in test/golden/failures/
```

### Build Failures
- Check Flutter version matches CI (3.24.5)
- Clear build cache: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
- Check for dependency conflicts

### CI Pipeline Issues
- **Build job**: Usually dependency or compilation issues
- **Test job**: Unit test failures or coverage issues  
- **Golden Tests**: Visual regression detection
- **Code Quality**: Formatting or analysis issues

## üìä Metrics & Monitoring

We track several key metrics:
- Test coverage percentage
- Build success rate
- Golden test stability
- AI classification accuracy
- Performance benchmarks
